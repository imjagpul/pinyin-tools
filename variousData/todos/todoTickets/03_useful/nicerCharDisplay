STEP:
 add link to system description
STEP:
  trancription always there, in yellow
  - for multiple allow ; for autosuggest
STEP:
  alternate compositions
  get rid of the buggy listbox, just a clickable list
  when alternate are really there
  and test if no funny behavior when no subkeywords are defined
STEP:
 fix add primary link: need autosugesst (and make it switchable by a button or so) 
STEP: 
 _detail.php :  make look nicer 
  make compositions nice 
  (a merge from GoldenDict#Modern look and Matthews PDF book styles)
  compomentns not underlined#_detail.php :  make look nicer  (maybe; or maybe keywords only) 
STEP:
  after made compositions nice, apply in system listing (_view.php ; http://localhost/pt/char/bySystem/10) as well
STEP:
make consistent with view
 http://localhost/pt/char/view/16091
  (get rid of view, link to lookup - just with a highligh - (below - same char, same keyword))
