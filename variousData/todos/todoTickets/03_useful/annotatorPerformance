CACHING
optimize annotator (precached for offline)
 					(a solution for kindle)
                     (old:char only kindle - hopefully faster)

precache single chars for specific settings
perhaps precache whole texts with specific settings (md5?)
reduce HTML - remove spaces 
reduce HTML - perhaps even use GBK to get faster
reduce HTML - what about gzip compression (for cached files?)

//FF sucks for big files b) slow  
// 1) input output b) job queue
 
refactor output:
   show in browser
   generate offline page
   generate offline page - non-js
   //generate .mobi file
