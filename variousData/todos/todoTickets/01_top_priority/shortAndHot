http://localhost/pt/s/%E4%B8%AD
中央人民政府驻香港特别行政区联络办公室
 has truncated pronunciation
 reimport with fresh version
---
unknown characters are not marked in quick annotator
---
some characers might be missing from the HSK
but hard to find a good list

http://www.hanzidb.org/character-list/hsk
 (in examples)
lists 2663 , we have only 2636

SOLUTION: first: 
 add the "list all characters" ability to annotator,
 then it will be trivial to generate own static page
 nice looking

traditional_only

vs 
AEngine
----
in chars browse http://localhost/pt/s - underline less strong

need to be able to delete entries

chardefs longer that one characters need to be displayed smaller

and it also sucks on online usage

convert želva a ostatní česká slova

even more funny (need matthews revision):
http://localhost/pt/s/brigade

all others (parse from dict)

test logins

logged in users should start in their profile page

cosmetics suck in QUPzilla

zambo might be pejorative

remove Settings from the menu - but add a note on the relevant places

! need PT to generate transcription and tooltip simplified on traditional
