HRER : reimporting components. next step> 
mass replace html to [] syntax

!keyword list
 (
   old reimport:
    颗	<b>number of satellites</b><br/>(A kid supposed to study biology.) A <span style="font-weight:600;">page </span>with <span style="font-weight:600;">fruits</span>, how boring... &quot;Do you know, what <span style="font-weight:600;">number of satellites </span>are there on the sky?&quot; The <span style="font-weight:600; color:#ff0000;">giant</span> closed the <span style="font-weight:600; color:#ff0000;">curtain </span>(to help him concentrate on the subject).<br/>fruit 果 + page 页
    
    compomenent or keyword:
    <span style="font-weight:600;"></span>
    soundword or archetype:
    <span style="font-weight:600; color:#ff0000;">     
 )

////

sorting steps:
  
  maintenance
    *reimport?
     (would having the soundswords be helpful? but from where should they be extracted?)
    ALT:
     *reformat the hard way
     *then import soundwords
     *then manual fill soundwords
     *maintenance / list
                  / autocorrect button
     
   
   *mnemonics rules
   *check: correspondence of transcription and given rules for mnemonics  


steps:
 optimize annotator (precached for offline)
 					(a solution for kindle)
                     (old:char only kindle - hopefully faster)
 user registration and profiles
 sort the systems
 lang8style
  
generalize systems:
 (list of pinyins => keywords and archetypes) [c] to markup no link
 
make texts easy!
 add bible first
 
refactor output:
   show in browser
   generate offline page
   generate offline page - non-js
   //generate .mobi file

post the recommendations on blog and add links on char/matthews
remove hardcoded simplified
wheel as options (above the dictionaries)

  @ INET: cosmetics browse 
     Browse:
                                                                Filter
       NAME         editor: USERNAME   Browse Favorite Hide (icons)
        TARGET
        SHORTDESC
  @ INET: style username in browse (gray, link, right position) 
     onclick name - show desc
     

DONE:嚎
DB_SORT:  MAKE mnemonic: 戍蔑缄幔 榨 忤粹 add as representative: 棘
蔑 澎湃痍 (cely jeremiah) 

add lookup> mark szstems as favorite, hide, pagination for lookup

troubles:
//FF sucks for big files b) slow  
// 1) input output b) job queue
 
db is confusing
 2) do the parsing
 
GUI is ugly
 *main page - at least four lines per paragraph (co takhle to postnout na lng8,aby to zkontrolovali)
            * add images to illustrate the titles
 			* start with a simple pic - what this does (inspired by lang8.com)
 *Settings - remove the tab and add it next to the logged in box instead
quickpub:
 registration
 
 
keyword in html output has to be escaped (") (?)

adding
 system - a change link (as a part of non-js interface)

==USEFUL
texts
caching


order:  
1.texts - add a few classics with sound from librivox; add canotnese + note
 *just cosmetics - apply the plugin
 *needs to have cahcing annotator implemented first
 *import the giles
2. demo page
 *cometics - line by line
 *test notice and link to soft and online service 
 *parse http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/San_Tzu_Ching/San_Tzu_Ching , add as a mnemonic sistem
3. users registration

4. menu e.g. in char/index
pub
5. sort

TO TEST:
You may need to run the texts through an aligner like LF aligner first.
http://aligner.sourceforge.net/


TEXTS to add:

PARTS:
nice menu

PRESENTATION:

index char
*make usable (with menu, nicer lists)
*down by radicals data
*(add by Hessing)
~/Data/javaprojekty/PinyinToolsDb/data/HSK

quick bugs:
DONE: *resolve bug afte rlogin " not authorized"
*tune bugs in menu
*keyword binding - suggests bad chars
 add bug new char - compositions, when you do not fill keyword, other input is not kept
 why fails? http://localhost/pt/s/drag 
display char
*make nice (e.g. http://localhost/pt/s/%E4%B8%AA )
 
lookup char
*make compositions nice
#_detail.php :  make look nicer (a merge from GoldenDict#Modern look and Matthews PDF book styles)
  ##compomentns not underlined (maybe; or maybe keywords only) 
 
 edit chars:
 *No results found => no comps set
 *when adding comp manually, "No results found" stay
 *delete stopped working as ajax
*add char compositions
 1. tips descriptions
 2. implement non-javascript interface (suggest; CompositionsEditor: add, remove)

user registration
*add system
*show system
*user settings

annot: kindle (odf) 

mass import
export
              (PR_COSMETICS)
*about -> image on title page 
       DONE: -> tweet-friendly; rule of 3; tell stories (; 1h)
       -> links to blog

*Edit (PR_WIS)
 Wysiwig ;2h
 
*Usage tips
 how to start (pick a system, import)
 read with annotator
  
*Annotator (5h)(WD_ANN)
 View.php: Note (tightly connected with )

 *online
   *settings (which system)
   *direct input
   *example text
   
   *direct output
   //*kindlegen output //zatim jenom link na offline, az bude webserver, tak to zprovoznit
   //   *txt uplaod
 *offline
 "Kindle dictionary"
   (run PC or read online)
   (don't have I kindle? maybe it's time to *get one*)
   (but of course you can use any mobile device, if you don't mind reading out of LCD screens)
*Text examples (2h)(PR_TEXTS)
  bible
  wuxia
  normal books
  classics

WEB DEVELOP:

CURRENT:
testcase:
你
晏
蠹

*hide compositions

 
*lastchange

*dictionary results link
 *in settings trad/simpl


#user settings:
##prefered pinyin format (fu4 fú )
**traditional / simplified preference

#hide php extension

ANNOTATOR DEVELOP (after pub):
*cantonese dict - convert from stardict

^ Settings / browser: default / spec 
^ Show in browser | Save as - GUI design

*notes more user friendly (some kind of gui editor)
^^ list untagged
^^ tag editing support

*make colorsdialog nicer (a color chooser and layout more regular)
*a nice chinese icon

DB_SORT (wild estimate: 30h; need to measure time speed):
Matthews : set all subcompositions (80/388 #100)
go throught all, inspect, merge old and new

#add japanese, korean; hessig etc.
#Matthews sort, add mnemos as private; maybe (ask) even public

AFTER PUB

Refactoring:
add "with" on correct places
delete "search" methods
convert DictionaryWidget & LoginForm to CPortlet subclasses
(maybe) replace all DBCriteria::compare with DBCriteria::addCondition  (or at least make sure "like" is not used)
performance : link assets
