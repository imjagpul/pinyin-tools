== Why ==

I want to share my original approach to learning Chinese.
I want to create an opportunity for a passive income.
I want to build a following / community.

== Current principle ==
Make it into a useful tool that can be shared, and then publish as soon as possible.

== Next step == 
(see #annotatorPerformance)
Offline and Portable - works quite fine
Quick - currently does not work
Parallel - currently does not work
 
 
 ---
 Propagate this as soon as possible.
Do only that what is necessary to prevent harm being done.
Then all other features.
It will be easier to develop after deploying.

There are many annotators but only this one allows you to customize the results and use your ebook reader.


FOCUS: 
8A Anntoator

FOCUS NEXT:
*make adding character to primary system work
*make the compositions editor bugfree
*harvesting keywords
*annotator - list unknown
*annotator - list known
*annotator - export epub / mobi

ACTION STEPS:
1 Create a home page
  $ a) Make title page link work. 
  $) Design nice homepage (#homepage)
   $ I)   get access to the HTML: a create and use a new template in PY
   $ II)  design silos
     $ *) add four links
     $ *) link to manual
     $ *) link to browse (landing page)
     $  *) create register to add landing page (with some explanation)
     $   **) make char / add lead to: 1) landing registrating (at unregistered) 2) system creation (if no user registered)
     $   **) user profile add some meaningful data //$ but could have more, see #user
     $   **) create browse landing page 
     $  *) link to annotator       
    $ III) design quote
    $ IV)  design message triplet
    $ V)   add CTA
  $ c) Link home page to demopage
   
2 Create a good demo page   
  $ d) Find out why demopage behaves funny on http://localhost/pt/annotator/generateDemo/0
  $ e) Fix xing2 mnemo - is broken
  $ f) Add audio
  $ g) Add synoptic text
  h) Make the demo page aestetically appealing
   *) make the mnemonics display on both traditional and simplified (no green chars)
   
   *) make the scroll bar more visible and not jumping randomly
   **) the scroll bar must not include mnemonics
   **) now, do we need to reconstruct the whole annotator?  << DEPENDS on 8
   
   *) make an EPUB generator
   i) Generate MOBI and EPUBs for downloads
   j) test the eBook files on the devices
  
3 Write the full manual description //takes hours but is a lot of fun
  a) add next / previous links on the bottm
  b) find the old focuswriter document
  c) review the four articles already written
  d) write the rest of the texts (see #manual)
  e) add a link to "the story behind it" ( http://localhost/pt/site/page - but change the url) to the homepage
  f) make sure the creepy page is gone
  g) review Systems (add links) if not yet done

3 User registration, login, logout
 $ a) fix - find out why Remember me doesnot work
 $ b) test registration
 $ c) User Settings - now says it is invalid, make it work
   d) #user
  
4 Browse page - cosmetics
   a) underline make thinner (PROBABLY DEPENDS: 8d)
 $ b) make matthews browse look seriously
   c) (not just browse page, also home page) - when the browser is not wide enough, it wraps the menu and the quotes in a funny way
  
5 Char view
  a) paint / realign links (the add, the edit links are somewhat funny - when logged in) http://localhost/pt/s/%E6%89%AE
  *) paint char edit flow (suggestions JS/noJS/ajax/noAjax)  
  b) make the add link work
  c) #charEditForm - suggestions
  d) make it behave intelligently when typing nonsense (/ a nonexisting compositions - show a message and a link to create a new one)

6 Texts 
  a) add a few wuxia and classics and normal books examples
  b) make it look appealing (paint / hide links)

7 Systems
  a) PLAN LATER : either dleete old or reimport / merge my own
  b) make existings chardefs one char only
    *create a fonts test page  
  c) heisig system
  d) reimport compositions
  e) description - add into the systemsViewRightSidebar.php (see also systemsViewSidebar.php) 

8 Annotator
  a) RECONSTRUCT: #annotatorPerformance     
  b) (maybe later) make EPUB generation work
  c) parallel make work (then add MuLan to examples)
  d) list characters ability (?)
  e) set a text limit
  
9 Publicate
  a) put online
  b) test user registration, create mnemonic
    (try unauth access, register, creat, add, remove, delete, recover password, remember me login - home page should not be displayed)
    try Remember me - if it works better than on localhost
  
  c)  
  d) test homepage on mobile devices
  e) test on opera, FF on win
  f) test on qupzilla
    
    
10 Propagate
  a) post betatest request on a forum
  b) talk about it via italki

11 Backup
  a) use the script as in data  
-----
Obstacles:
#homepage Unfinished home page.
#annotatorPerformace - Annotator needs tuning to be usable.

Necessary:
#sortSystems
#legacy
#demoPage
