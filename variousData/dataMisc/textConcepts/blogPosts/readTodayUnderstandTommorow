On my language learning path, I often meet people that assume you need to have almost-native level skills to be able to read foreign language books.
To be able to open such a book, you need to have all the grammar mastered, as well as know all the vocabulary, right?

Let me assure you, it is the other way around. 

You must start reading long texts right after you are able to recognize the letter of the language. (Which, for most languages, is the first day you start. Even though for Chinese language it is a non-trivial problem – but it has ###a solution).

Note I target here for a deep language skills.
These tips are a very efficient way to gain both a perfect way to gain both a perfect passive comprehension (of both written and spoken languages) and also a solid basis for producing vocabulary-rich
