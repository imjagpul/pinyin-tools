###this might be a good entry point for the article

Back then I read somewhere that the difference between an introvert and a shy person is that the introverts don't socialize because they feel no need for it. The shy people would like to, but are too nervous or embarrassed about meeting and speaking to other people. They tend do better with the people that are more familiar to them.

I felt this description didn't fit me. Being nervous was not a problem for me (or at least not a major one).  I had nothing to say even with people I knew and liked.

I admired the people that shined.  
### elaborate
### … prechod They seem 

Now I turned into one.
Whatever place I walk into, it feels like having close friends all around.
It reminds me of a Chinese quote: “Isn't it a joy to have friends coming from distant quarters?”
----

Note that extroverted people that read this article, might think: “Hey, just that's just too complicated. Just get out there and talk. Analysis paralysis. “ And it's true: the best way to practice talking with people is to talk with people. 

However, in the state I described above “get out there and talk” just doesn't work – because you are not able to talk.

** RPG games example **
An example inspired by the role-playing games will hopefully make it clear:
Imagine being on level 1, but all the monsters you could find would be level 30.
For people being on level 29 it might be possible to gain experience fighting with these monsters, even if it is an uneven fight. But the player on level 1 is not able to hit even a single strike before getting killed – only to get frustrated and stop trying.
Luckily, he discovers there is another way of improving his combat skills – there is a training area where he can practice hitting dummies (that don't strike back). 

If you are level 29 – don't waste time with dummies and go in the wilderness. 
But if you are level 1 and cannot find level 2 monsters – starting with dummies might be a good idea.

Do not envy the extroverts that received their speaking skills “for free” from the environment they grew up in. If you will practice diligently, you will ultimately get better than them – you will reach the level 60, while they might still be stuck around level 30, because they don't practice consciously. And you have yet another advantage – if you didn't grow up talking, chances are, you grew up reading, studying or with some other useful skill (even playing videogames might be a useful experience that can be employed to your avail). After you knowingly gain the extrovert abilities, you don't lose your introvert ones – so you end up having both.

*** So what can you do  ***
=== The way I got there ===
after I tried googling
separate areas: public speaking – you can find plenty of articles how to do it. 
But I had no real problems public speaking (maybe because I had a good memory – see  ###How to gain an absolute memory).

What bothered me ###

In the later phrases, I knew I had to respond by elaborating on the topic that was just being spoken about in the conversation, but even when I came up with an idea, the conversation has already moved elsewhere.

Another thing that alienated me was my voice. The process of learning requires good feedback. However, when speaking with a bad voice, usually the only feedback you'll get is a blank stare. That is enough to make you understand something is wrong and frustrate you, but not enough 

I was often asked to repeat myself.

*** Topic training with example ***

For example, after I spent some time messing with Bitcoins (my address is ###… , feel free to send me some coins :-) ), I thought it might be a fun thing to explain to my non-technical friends.

Even though I was able to bring that topic up and say a few sentences, it wasn't a coherent and well-structured speech I would love to say.

So I decided to practice this topic at home first. 
First I drafted an outline:
###
Then I recorded myself speaking along this outline.
### (img)
I use ###link### Audiacity for recording – it's nice because you can see the pauses between words clearly (and also how loud you are actually talking). 

If you are not able to speak freely along the outline, write the full text word-for-word and then just read that.

At the beginning stages I often made almost 10 seconds pauses between single words. (Since this happened not only in the training sessions but also outside in the real world, I wonder what a bother it had to be to listen to me at that time.)

I repeatedly practiced the topic until I managed to say it out loud fluently (without any unwanted pauses, stammering or mumbling). Note it takes some time. Sometimes I had to recored over 10 attempts before I was happy with the result. (You'll get better with the time, so don't panic! :-) )

*** How to make it fun ***
If you start feeling bored (that's what kept me stucked for a long time), see if you have these problems:
*lack of dreams
Dreams (note the word "dream" does NOT imply it will not become true!) are what keeps the motivation burning.

If your actions are not aligned with your dream, you will end up procrastrinating, and even if you finally force yourself to action, the results will be disappointing and you will give up soon. It will be like hitting the air.

On the other hand, when working towards a dream, it's like floating along a river. It will bother you that you are tired and cannot work anymore.
//Rule number one : convert your goal into a dream

*lack of novelty
If your dream is really strong, this won't be a problem. But if your motivation is weak, it might help to introduce novelty.
//How to do it?

*** Voice drill ***
If you tend to mumble, you might want to practice speaking louder (in order to get used to speaking loud – at the beginning it will feel like you are yelling, afterwards it will be perfectly natural).
Just grab any text you are interested in reading and read it loud. You will get better results if you record yourself and check how loud you are actually speaking (play the recording in order to hear if you are pronouncing clearly enough, not skipping any consonants, speaking slowly enough and with correct intonation).

After you develop the ability to read with a good voice, move to the topic training described above, this time concentrating not only on the content, but also on your voice (you might not mumble while reading, but do mumble when speaking spontaneously).

After doing that you will have enough experience to judge if you speak clearly when talking to other people. In case you'll get nervous, just breathe slowly and you'll be fine.

*** Goal settings ***
So, if you are using the goal planning (if you don't, you should), here 
are some goals you might want to put:
Tell ### to three various real persons.
 steps: train the topic, find a person, tell the topic

By my own painful (ok, not so painful) experience, goals NOT to set:
Gain the habit (10 min /day) of doing topic training daily.
 (This is a little tricky, because it seems as a clearly defined goal
  ("topic training" is what I clearly described above.).
  The problem with it is not motivational.Training is not a goal, it is just a tool.
  With this you would only end up procrastrinating.
  You have to set up a goal that reflects what you want become,
  not the way to reach it. )
