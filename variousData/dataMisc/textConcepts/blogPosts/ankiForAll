(stories, structure on paper)

As I've visited a friend of mine recently, her son was just unwrapping 
a shiny package full of small cartoon cards. The pleasing smell of ozone filled the room.

Nor poker cards. On the other side was something written: "der Frosch".
These were flashcards meant to learn German.

FOR VOCABULARY ONLY COMPLEMENTARY
Note that, what the language learning concerns, I don't 
advocate spending your life practicing vocablary with your flashcards.
