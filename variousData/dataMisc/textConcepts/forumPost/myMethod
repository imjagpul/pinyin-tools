<h2>How I've learned Chinese</h2>

 <p>
The Chinese characters turned to be quite a challenge, as in order to be able to recognize all characters you normally meet, you have to know at least 3500 of them (and you will still keep meeting some you have never seen before).
<p>
I've used a method that worked excellently for me before: <b>read</b> and <b>listen</b> a lot. You need:
<ul>
<li>a book (you can find many online for free 
<li>an audio recording of the same text
<li>a translation to a language you understand well (at least at the beginning stages)
</ul> 

<p>
Using this method I learned over 3500 characters in three years, studying only in
free time (full-time college students learn reportedly only about 1500).

In order to spare time turning pages in a dictionary, run the text through this annotator:
