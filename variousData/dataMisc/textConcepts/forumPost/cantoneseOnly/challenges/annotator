I've learned Mandarin by reading a lot of texts (annotated with pinyin - [annotator link]), 
while listening to the corresponding audio.
I'm quite happy with the results, I've made a lot of progress quickly.

Now I'd like to learn Cantonese. I managed to find some texts in Cantonese. 
What I couldn't find is some kind of cantonese annotator (something to convert the text
to jyutping -  like [], but for cantonese; and preferably offline.
