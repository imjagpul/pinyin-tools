The [c=words ]words [/c]were [c= beg 乞]begging [/c]instead of the person - after his personal begging was [k]finished[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]thinks the beggar is eating too much [p]cheese[/p], and gives nothing.
The [c= imperial 皇]imperial [/c]son took a [c=step forward ]step forward [/c]ad then back. His mentor scolds him: &quot;As a member of the imperial family you must not be so [k]capricious[/k]!&quot; But then, the [p]ghostly fairy[/p], his guardian, shows him a trick how to pass through the training [p]hangar[/p].
He looked several [c=times 次 ]times [/c]on the [c= woman 女]woman[/c]. Is it her [k]beauty [/k]that attracts him? He also looks to the [p]giant [/p]sitting next to him - but he only hears &quot;[p]zzz...[/p]&quot; (the giant is obviously not caught by her beauty).
He was supposed to be [c= {behead 斩}]beheaded[/c], but instead, they decided to drow him [k]gradually [/k](in [c=water 水 ]water[/c], obviously). The [p]two dwarfs[/p] say to each other: &quot;That'll teach him not to mess up with our [p]generator [/p]anymore (water is used to power the generator).&quot;
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]shot with his [c= &quot;crossbow&quot; 弗]crossbow[/c] - and hit a [k]Buddha[/k] statue by accident. The [p]fairy[/p] says to him: &quot;Let's run away quickly, [p]follow[/p] me!&quot;
He tries to move the [c= cow <span style="color:#ffaa00;">牛</span>]cow [/c]out of his [c=house ]house[/c], but she holds [k]firmly[/k]. In the end the [p]fairy [/p]has to play [p]loud [/p]music into her ear (then she goes at last)
Give me a hand - removing the [c= hook]hook [/c](and thorns) from his [c=hand ]hand[/c], and afterwards [k]bind [/k]it, please. The [p]giant [/p]got wounded while helping build the [p]zareeba[/p].
&quot;What is the [c=net 罒 ]net[/c]-like looking [c= leather 革 ]leather [/c]thing you have put on the [c= horse 马]horse[/c]?&quot; the kid asks. &quot;It's called a [k]bridle[/k].&quot; <br />The [p]giant [/p]doesn't need it as he drives in [p]jeep [/p]instead.
They had to follow the [c=road ]road [/c]to [k]go back[/k], unfortunately he was [c= opposed 反]opposed [/c]to it. He wanted to hear [p]Teddy [/p]play [p]fanfares [/p]one more time.
The [c=step 步 ]steps [/c]that had to be done took one [c= page 页]page[/c]. He reads it [k]repetitiously[/k]. He wants to be able to dance with the [p]fairy [/p]- but actually only in order to get the pineapples. He hopes he won't get pinned down by the [p]pins [/p]on her clothing.
A [c=bundel ]bundel [/c]is lying on the [c= road]road[/c]. (It moves.) &quot;Open it [k]fast[/k]!&quot; As he opens it - a [p]dwarf [/p]was tied there. &quot;Some evil people wanted to sell me for meat to the [p]supermarket [/p](but they didn't accept me so they just left me lying here).
The [c=words 讠]words [/c]hanged out in the [c= public 公]public [/c]was the declaration of the [k]litigation[/k]. They got too annoyed by the [p]dwarf [/p]singing the [p]song [/p](over and over again).
He ran up very [c= energetic 贲]energetically[/c] to the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave. As he wanted to go in, a [k]spray [/k](of ink) welcomed him. The [p]giant [/p]accidentally dropped his (giant) [p]pen [/p](exactly in the moment as he wanted to energetically rush in).
The [c=tree 木 ]trees [/c]from [c= east 东]east [/c]were used to build a [k]number of buildings[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]goes then east on his [p]donkey [/p]to bring more.
The [c= inflammation 炎]inflammation [/c]spread all over his body that was covered by the [c=wool 毛 ]wool[/c]. Perhaps he should get a better [k]blanket [/k](of a different material). [p]Teddy [/p]offers to asks through the [p]tannoy [/p]if anybody could lend him such a blanket (unfortunately he forgets what he was supposed to say when he started talking).
The [c=house ]house [/c]was full of [c= traditional-page 頁 ]traditional pages [/c](on the walls). She took a [c= knife 刀]knife [/c]and cut them all down. She wanted no traditional pages after she was [k]widowed[/k]. The [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]guarded the fire (she has made of the pages) in the [p]garten[/p].
After doing a review of the [c= farm 农]farm [/c]under [c=moon 月 ]moonlight [/c](after work), [k]pus [/k]starts dripping of his arm (but he pays no attention). But the [p]fairy [/p]thinks it is really [p]nonglaring [/p]and he should go to a doctor.
The [c= king 王]king [/c]wants the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]to shine, in order to keep all his flowers [k]blooming[/k]. He sends [p]Wang [/p]the [p]dwarf [/p]to check the weather.
&quot;How come that your [c=child ]child [/c]is so [c= small]small[/c]? &quot;Actually, it is my [k]grandson[/k]!&quot; &quot;But I believe he will turn to a giant [p]soon[/p]!&quot; the [p]giant[/p] says.
The [c= dog 犬]dog [/c]had to go throught the [c=door 户 ]door[/c]. Through closed door. How [k]ruthless[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p](his master) [p]leaps [/p]inside after him.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]has been asked to [c= act as; for 为]act as[/c] a [k]bogus [/k]bank manger. [p]Teddy [/p]hopes [p]Wei[/p] will not notice (and he will be able to make fun of her afterwards).
He got a (gingerbread) [c=heart ]heart[/c], packed a in piece of [c= cloth]cloth[/c]. But instead of making him happy, he got [k]terrified[/k]. The [p]dwarf[/p] had said to him, if he'll ever get a cloth-packed organ, he will take even his [p]boots[/p], and in the end he will die by a <span style="font-style:italic;">lightning</span> strike.
The soldier [k]thatches [/k]his shield with the [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]- hopefully it will make him a harded target - and he tests it by striking it with a [c= spear 矛]spear[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]warns him that he must take care not to let a [p]mouse [/p]eat the thatch.<br />(thatch is a kind of palm or something, and to thatch menas to cover (e.g.) a roof with the grass)
He was measuring [c= grain 禾]grain [/c]by loading it with a [c= spoon 匕 ]spoon [/c]on a [c=page 页 ]page [/c]of a book. He was able to help himself in all sorts of situations - he was very [k]gifted[/k].<br>[p]Ying [/p]is very proud of this [p]Teddy[/p].
The [c=tree 木 ]trees [/c]are not all the [c= same 同]same[/c]! This one, for example, is [k]Chinese wood-oil tree[/k]. The one [p]fairy [/p]likes to craft her magic [p]tongs [/p]of.
He [c=turn in one's sleep 夗 ]turns in his sleep[/c]. O, my [c= heart 心]heart[/c], my heart, why do you [k]blame[/k] me of so many things. The [p]dwarf [/p]will surely soon <span style="font-style:italic;">complain</span> that somebody stole him so many [p]yuan [/p]coins.
She had [c=hold on to 执 ]hold on to [/c]her [c= clothing 衣]clothing[/c]. &quot;It would be [k]licentious[/k]!&quot; The [p]two dwarfs [/p]kindnap her into their [p]shack[/p].
(A kid supposed to study biology.) A [c= page 页]page [/c]with [c=fruit 果 ]fruits[/c], how boring... &quot;Do you know, what [k]number of satellites [/k]are there on the sky?&quot; The [p]giant[/p] closed the [p]curtain [/p](to help him concentrate on the subject).
The [k]dragon [/k]liked to play like a child, and he [c=especially 尤 ]especially [/c]loved the [c= slide]slide[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]summons a very [p]long [/p]slide for him.
The scythe of the [c=banshee (<span style="font-style:italic;">smrtka</span>) ]banshee [/c]broke: she had to take two pieces of wood - and make a [k]mortise [/k]in them (to replace the handle of the scythe) and [c= seal 卩]seal [/c]them together. [p]Teddy [/p]is happy that his [p]mouse [/p]can live a little bit longer.
Could you give me a [c=hand 手 ]hand[/c]? We have to go through the city but [k]disturb [/k]nobody - [c= especially 尤]especially [/c]not the guards. [p]Teddy [/p]works hard to control himself, especially in [p]Rao[/p] (it could cost him his life there).
The [c= toad 黾]toad [/c]sticked the tongue out: and the [c=insect 虫 ]insect [/c]was eaten already. Toads like insects, especially [k]musca[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]thinks that a nature excursion will excite [p]Ying[/p].
Here is a [c=bundle 束 ]bundle [/c]of [c= horns]horns [/c]and if you need more, just leave me a [k]note[/k]. The [p]two Teddies [/p]cooperate to check if they are [p]genuine[/p].
The [c= insect <span style="color:#ffaa00;">虫</span>]insect [/c]asked for some [c=food ]food [/c]- the [p]fairy [/p]brings him a [p]shallot[/p]. But it only [k]nibbles [/k]it and flies away.
The skeleton was unhappy as it had no [k]muscles[/k]. So he at least fastened some [c=bamboo ]bamboo [/c]sticks to his [c=???]ribs [/c]- as replacement for the muscles. The [p]giant [/p]gives him some [p]gin [/p](the skeleton can drink now that the missing muscles between his ribs have been replaced with bamboo).
His hair grew very quickly, so he was quite [c=shaggy 髟 ]shaggy[/c]. In contrast, his [k]whiskers [/k]did grow very [c= slowly 冉]slowly[/c]. It is the curse casted by the [p]fairy[/p], until they pay a [p]ransom[/p].
&quot;[c= sudden 忽]Suddenly[/c], he pointed at his [c=heart ⺖]heart [/c]and said he feels very [k]muzzy[/k]!&quot; After he explodes the [p]giant [/p]clears his remains with a [p]hoover[/p].
&quot;A [c= nail 丁]nail [/c]of [c=gold 金 ]gold [/c]is also a [k]nail[/k].&quot; the [p]giant [/p]thinks as he nails up the new [p]dinghy[/p].
The ones who are too [c= tall]tall [/c]to use a [c=car 车 ]car [/c]use a [k]palanquin[/k] up to present days. But even the [p]two dwarfs [/p]let themselves carry in a palanquin to the [p]jousting [/p]match (they thinks it looks cool).
I need [c= to help 助]help [/c](I need to dig the garden to earn my living). The [p]fairy [/p]summons a [k]hoe [/k]with a spell. &quot;Wow, it's made of [c=gold 金 ]gold[/c]! (Perhaps I won't have to use it at all.) How can I repay you? Take at least a [p]chewing [/p]gum.&quot;
The [c=grass 草 ]grass [/c]asked for [c= &quot;a drink&quot; 曷]a drink[/c], so the [k]kudzu [/k]climbs up (a wall of a house), wanting to snatch something from the kitchen. But the [p]fairy [/p]notices it and replants the kudzu around a [p]girder[/p].<br /><br />(also name of Sister Ge in  天龙八部)<br />surname: <span style="color:#00aa00;">葛</span>
The [c=sheep 羊 ]sheep [/c]seems to have something wrong with it's [c= heart 心]heart[/c]. She has an [k]indisposition[/k]! The [p]dwarf [/p]tries [p]yanking [/p]her (if it helps).
&quot;I'll do [c=whatever 任 ]whatever [/c]it takes to get her [c= heart 心]heart [/c]back!&quot; But that he considers if it is really prudent to foster [k]such [/k]ideas and such feelings. The [p]dwarf [/p](who wants to get rid of him) suggests: &quot;Why don't you [p]run [/p]to her right away?&quot;.
The [c= sheep 羊]sheep [/c]started fleeing throught the [c=water 水 ]water[/c], and didn't stop until she reached the [k]ocean[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]then managed to [p]yang[/p] her back.
[c=harry ]Harry [/c]flying with a [c= two (biplane)]biplane[/c]: it's the [k]humane [/k]<span style="font-style:italic;">kernel</span> of the otherwise robotic army<br>The [p]fairy [/p]paints: &quot;[p]Run[/p]!!!&quot; as the army moves towards the city.
He was [c=hold on to 执 ]holding on to [/c]her [c= hand 手]hand[/c]. She's thinking if he's [k]undesigning[/k], or if the [p]dwarf [/p]only wants to take a bath in her [p]jacuzzi[/p].<br /><br />sincere: 亶
<br />The guard was sitting [c= solemn 肃]solemnly [/c]at the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave - until [k]hissing[/k] catched his attention: &quot;Get out of here, a <span style="font-style:italic;">tsunami </span>is coming! The [p]two dwarfs[/p] wanted a lot water for their [p]showers[/p] (and the experiments went wrong - summoning a tsunami)&quot;<br />海啸 - tsunami
The [c= unicorn]unicorn[/c] have recieved an [c=seal ]seal[/c] - he has to [k]guard[/k] it. The [p]dwarf [/p]checks whether the seal has the correct [p]weight[/p] at the time of delivery.
She tried hard to [c= reach 及]reach [/c]the water in the [c=water ]well[/c], but it is not so easy to [k]draw water from well[/k]. The [p]fairy[/p] helps her by stopping a [p]jeep[/p] going by (and asking the driver to help).
A [c=walk 走 ]walk [/c]with a [c= fortune teller 卜]fortune teller [/c]might turn out to be a [k]voyage[/k] (perhaps into an astral world). But not for the [p]dwarf[/p] - he only speaks about [p]food[/p].
The [c= {goverment 府}]goverment [/c]captured an alien from the [c=moon 月 ]moon[/c]. The scientics study now it's [k]internal organs[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]says: It's looks a little like [p]foo yong[/p]!
Ok, so cut this [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c], perhaps in the form of an [c= orchid 兰]orchid[/c], and make the fence beautiful! &quot;C'mon, it's just a [k]fence[/k].&quot; But the [p]fairy [/p]hangs [p]lanterns [/p]to decorate it anyway.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]meets the emblem of the [k]NI [/k]family: A [c= boy ]boy [/c]with a [c= mortar]mortar[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]asks: &quot;Why don't the paint a [p]kNee [/p]instead?&quot; (pronounced like NI).<br /><img src="pasteqborzm.jpg" />
As he returns from the [c= trade 商]trade [/c]center, the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]still [k]drips [/k]from him. The [p]giant [/p]wants to take no [p]detour [/p]and go to the next market immediately.
[c= Fuxi 羲]Fuxi [/c]teached the humans that the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]brings the [k]light of day[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]tries to teach this to his [p]sheeps[/p].
The [c= boy 儿]boy [/c]wants to play with a [c=cocoon ]cocoon[/c]. But it is not <span style="font-style:italic;">permitted</span> to him. &quot;That's not [k]fair[/k]!&quot; he complains. [p]Teddy[/p] offers him to play with him in the kids [p]Union [/p]instead.
If you feel that you are [c=none 莫 ]none[/c], or at least [c= small 小]small[/c], perhaps it's because you [k]admire [/k]the other person. But the [p]dwarf [/p]mumbles it's just useless [p]mumble[/p].<br /><span style="color:#0000ff;">爱慕</span> - adore
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]tries to make a [c= right (side) 右]right (side)[/c] turn. But he can't do it. He has to ask [p]dwarf [/p]the [p]yoga [/p]assistor to [k]assist [/k]him.
Obviously you think what is on the [c= page 页]page [/c]is [c=sincere 亶 ]sincere[/c], otherwise you wouldn't [k]tremble[/k]. But I'm afraid the [p]dwarf [/p]just want to take his [p]chance[/p].
[c=Harry ]Harry[/c] ('s hair) turned [c= white]white [/c](from the shock) as he found out that his [k]father's elder brother [/k]died. The [p]fairy [/p]puts him on a [p]board [/p](and attemps resurrection spells).
They have build a [c=shelter 广 ]shelter [/c]around the [c= dragon 龙]dragon [/c]to hide his [k]externality[/k]. He agreed to it under the condition, the [p]fairy [/p]will feed him with [p]pancakes [/p]every day.<br>脸庞 - face
The [c= yellow <span style="color:#ffaa00;">黄</span>]yellow [/c]animal is sitting on a [c=tree ]tree[/c]! &quot;How is it possible? &quot; &quot;The [p]fairy [/p]had [p]hung [/p]him there, it's a trick that he seems [k]horizontal [/k]now.&quot;
The [c= igloo 㐱]igloo[/c] was so [c=evil 歹 ]evil [/c]that they decided to [k]exterminate [/k]it. The [p]two Teddies [/p]started throwing [p]tandoori [/p]at it.
At [c= outer limits 冂]outer limits [/c]- they were attacking all [c=tree 木 ]trees [/c]they could find. It was a [k]thrusting [/k]practice. The [p]dwarf [/p]was keeping [p]statistics [/p]of how many hits they had.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]wanted to [c= {roll up <span style="color:#00aa00;">卷</span>}]roll up [/c]some cloths himself (because they're so precious) but he got too [k]tired [/k]to do it. So he asked the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]to guard the [p]jean[/p] doing it.
What for [c=black / mysterious 玄 ]black and mysterious [/c]figures are there on the [c= field 田]field[/c]? Hopefully they are not after our [k]livestock[/k]. But the [p]dwarf [/p]wants to be sure: he takes a [p]chewing [/p]gum (to boost his self-confidence) and goes to talk to them.
A [c= pigeon 隹]pigeon [/c]lands at the shore of a flowing [c=water ⺡]water[/c]. &quot;What is the name of this river?&quot; he asks. &quot;[k]Huai river[/k]&quot; the [p]ghostly fairy [/p]answers, guarding his [p]hay[/p].
Do you [k]feel attached to[/k] her [c=as well 亦 ]as well[/c]? Perhaps you should hide that in your [c= heart 心]heart[/c]. The [p]two dwarfs[/p] can prepare you two [p]lentil bowls [/p](you'll have to eat both of them alone) - to keep your sadness up. (Becuase she's mine.)
&quot;How exactly do you want the [c=water ]water [/c]to be brought into your castle?&quot; He gave them a plan painted on a [c= jade block 圭]jade block[/c]. He actually wants a [k]winding ditch[/k]. The [p]giant [/p](looking forward to the work): &quot;[p]Whooaaa[/p]!&quot;
As it threw the [c= clothes 衣]clothes [/c]away it turned out to be a [c=dragon 龙 ]dragon[/c], who started a [k]suprise attack[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]takes the [p]sheep [/p]and flies away (to save the sheep).
He has had some [c= trouble 娄]trouble [/c]with his [c=hand ⺘]hand[/c], but that didn't prevent him from [k]hugging [/k]her... The [p]Teddy[/p][p] [/p]suggests going into the [p]lounge[/p].
He moves the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]away and <span style="font-style:italic;">spits </span>[c= abrupt / sudden 卒]abruptly[/c]: &quot;[k]Tfuj![/k]&quot; The only luck of the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p](guarding the dungeon) is that kisses from [p]tsukubas [/p]are not deadly for ghosts.
We want our household to be in [c= style 式]style[/c], so please give me a [c=hand 手 ]hand [/c]to [k]rub out [/k]the the stains! The [p]dwarf [/p]will give you some [p]shallots [/p]to as a cleaning tool.
The [p]dwarf [/p]ate too much [p]pizza [/p]- in [c=  comparsion 比]comparsion [/c]with what he can handle. If he wouldn't [k]fart[/k], he would be thought to be a [c=corpse 尸 ]corpse[/c].
In [c= winter 冬]winter[/c], at the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth of a cave[/c], you hear [k]boom (of a drum)[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]is training his flock of [p]donkeys[/p].
Sitting at a balcony, <br>drinking rain [c=water ]water[/c], <br>bowed over the [c= balustrade 阑]balustrade[/c], <br>watching the [k]swelling water[/k]. <br>In the evening the [p]fairy [/p]comes, <br>extinguish her [p]lantern[/p], <br>...
&quot;Why did you let the [c=water ]water [/c]fall down on the floor?&quot; &quot;It's [c= inexpensive 贱]inexpensive [/c]- and I like the [k]splashing[/k] sound. After that I'm gonna play with the [p]generator [/p]made by the [p]two dwarfs [/p]- hopefully it won't kill me (especially as the floor is wet).&quot;
Why is the [c=rice ]rice[/c] so [c= big]big[/c]? Is it an unusual [k]kind[/k]? No, it's because the [p]dwarf[/p] diversed the [p]lake[/p] to water his rice.
They had to go for a [c=walk 走 ]walk[/c]. After that those who [k]limped [/k]got [c=???]lined up[/c]. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]are trying to find out who [p]lurked [/p]last night (and they know he limps).
The [c=words 言 ]words [/c]at the [c= temple]temple [/c]were all [k]poems[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]is tired of it and throws a [p]shallot [/p]at them.
The [c=hand 手 ]hand [/c]turned into a [c= claw 爪]claw [/c]at once, and [k]snatched [/k]her. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]takes a [p]jar [/p]and sticks her inside (a job is a job...).
The one had a [c=moon 月 ]moon[/c], the other the [c= Biela's comet 孛]Biela's comet[/c] tatooed on his [k]nape[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]asks: &quot;Hej, [p]borci[/p], what do the symbols on your nape mean?&quot;
The [c= dish]dish [/c]with the [c=heart ]heart[/c] painted on it has been left in the [c= sun ]sun [/c]- but the giver doesn't [k]feel hurt[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]suggests taking the [p]union[/p]'s help to find somebody else.
The [c=king ]king [/c]doesn't like diamonds, as they are too [c= white]white[/c]. So they bring him [k]amber[/k]. It was synthetized by the [p]dwarf [/p]from a [p]porcupine[/p].
At the [c=bamboo 竹 ]bamboo [/c]plantage, at the HQ they had a [k]registry [/k]of have many times it has already been [c= plough 耤]plough[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]is using her magic wand to tranfer the data into the registry from a [p]jeep [/p](so that they don't have to write it by hand).
[c= XI / (literary) what? 奚]&quot;What [/c]does the sign with the [c=foot 足 ]foot [/c](near the Xi family house) mean?&quot; &quot;It means this path is to be used as a [k]walkway [/k]only.&quot;<br>&quot;But the [p]giant [/p]uses it for the mutated [p]sheeps [/p](of the Xi family) too!&quot;
They had to [c= check up 查]check up [/c]the [c=stone 石 ]stone [/c]but they didn't - so they didn't find out it had a [k]fault[/k]. But the [p]fairy [/p]is happy to have no peaks on her [p]chart[/p].
He goes with a [c=mortar ]mortar [/c]to [c= work ]work[/c]. He is about to [c= strike]strike [/c]everything and [k]ruin [/k]his entire workplace (he only blinks at the porter). [p]Ghostly Teddy [/p]supposed to guard the workplace is busy playing with [p]hifi[/p].
These [c=words 讠 ]words [/c]were written there: &quot;Please be [k]cautious[/k]! The [c= clay 堇]clay [/c]is unstable.&quot; They were added after [p]Teddy [/p]flooded the soil with [p]jin[/p].
The [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]is sitting [c= stubborn 艮]stubbornly[/c], doesn't want to move, fierce face. So the master gets [k]fierce [/k]too and kicks him. [p]Teddy [/p]complains: I wanted to go [p]hunting [/p]with him!
He [c= contend 争]contended[/c]: &quot;Your [c=dog ⺨ ]dog [/c]is a [k]hideous [/k]creature!&quot; He was right: the [p]giant [/p]had brought him here from a [p]jungle[/p].
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]hat to clean the [c= snout 彐]snouts[/c], but only of the [k]female [/k](swines). The [p]dwarf [/p]brings them [p]food [/p]then.
&quot;Could we perhaps [c=to state 申 ]state[/c], that when the city will get more [c= sunny]sunny[/c], the people will feel theselves more [k]free[/k]?&quot; &quot;Mr.[p]Chang[/p]&quot;, answers the [p]dwarf[/p], &quot;I think that is a very good idea.&quot;
They have to swim over the [c=channel ]channel [/c]to get to the [c= power 力]power [/c]plant. But they are unsure, if they have enough [k]strength [/k]to do it. The [p]dwarf [/p]suggests drinking some [p]jin [/p]before.
(A military parade - in the night.) The [c= military 军]military [/c]walks, every soldier carries a [c=light 光 ]light[/c]... What [k]splendor[/k]! Especially with the [p]ghostly giant [/p]guarding the [p]hifi [/p](playing military music).
Our [c=cow 牛 ]cows [/c]are substantial for keeping us on [c= life 生]life[/c], along with other [k]domestic animals[/k]. That's why we hired a [p]giant [/p]to care about them - but now he has a pause in a [p]Schenke[/p].
&quot;Do you [c= trust 孚]trust [/c]the [c=water ]water [/c]is good? I have only [k]superficial [/k]information.&quot; &quot;Yes, the [p]fairy [/p]uses it to prepare [p]food [/p]every day. &quot;
&quot;Our [c=water 水 ]water [/c]is [c= also 也]also [/c]from the best [k]reservoir[/k].&quot; That's why [p]fairy [/p]uses it to cook the [p]chapati[/p].
Especially in the [c= west 西]west[/c], people like to lie in the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]to [k]sunbathe[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]tells [p]Šáry [/p]she is so ugly she should not sunbathe.
They desperately look for a [c= shelter 广]shelter [/c]against the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]in the [k]wilderness[/k]. Suddenly a [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]materializes: offering to transport them on his [p]cangaroo [/p]to the nearest one (for a fee...),
When the [c=druid (祭 without 示) ]druid [/c]learned the [k]tenth of the heavenly stems[/k], he looked up to the [c= heaven 天]heaven [/c]- and then he spotted the [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]playing [p]guitar[/p].
The polar [c=king 王 ]king [/c]hides his most [k]precious thing[/k] in his [c= &quot;igloo&quot; 㐱]igloo[/c]. The [p]giant[/p] brought the chocolate all the way from [p]Geneva[/p].
The [c= octopus 八]octopus [/c]accompanies the unicorn, armed only with an axe, they have to get through a group of [k]soldiers[/k] stationed on a [c=hillock 丘 ]hillock[/c]. After they manage it, the [p]giant [/p]yells: &quot;[p]BINGO[/p]!&quot;
The [c=rain 雨 ]rain [/c]was alternating with [k]frost [/k]every second, affecting themselves [c=???]mutually[/c]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]likes to play with weather in [p]Shanghai[/p].
He has already put his [c=foot ⻊ ]foot [/c]in the door, but that he [k]mammers [/k]again. Should I [c=???]make it known [/c]or not? The [p]fairy [/p]offers him a [p]chewing [/p]gum (for him to become less nervous).
They [c=entrust 委 ]entrusted [/c]the whole property of the [k]Wei dynasty [/k]to a [c= ghost 鬼]ghost[/c]. The [p]dwarf [/p]protests as he thinks the decision is not very well [p]weighed[/p].
He <span style="font-style:italic;">squanders</span> the [c= soup 汤]soup [/c]- on the [c=grass ]grass [/c](hoping it will help the grass grow). The [p]dwarf[/p] - [p]dangling[/p] a broom: &quot;You'll have to [k]sweep away[/k] the soup.&quot; (what's left of it - carrots etc.)
The [c=public 公 ]public [/c]areas were filled with [c= page 页]page[/c]s - of [k]ode[/k]s. The [p]dwarf [/p]murmles: &quot;I don't think that that [p]song [/p]was so extremly beautiful.&quot;
In the [c= old days 昔]old days[/c], [c=dog 犬 ]dogs [/c]were a welcomed help by [k]hunting[/k]. That's why the [p]two dwarfs [/p]take dogs with them when they go hunting [p]lurks[/p].
[c= mother]Mother[/c] has bought a new [c=plant ]plant[/c]. It is, however, quite dangerous - because it is [k]poison[/k]ous. The [p]fairy[/p] will cast a protective [p]duvet[/p] over it (so that nobody gets poisoned).
(Comparing strength with [c=hand 手 ]hands [/c]- they [k]shake [/k]as they [c= {fight over 斗}]fight over[/c], but suddenly one hand gets red hot und starts burning (because it shakes too much) - but [p]Teddy [/p]missed it, as he [p]dozes[/p])
At [c=dawn 旦 ]dawn[/c], the [c= unicorn 一]unicorn [/c]refused to let the people through, [k]extending all the way across[/k] the path. The [p]dwarf [/p]orders: &quot;Bring in some [p]gunpowder[/p]!&quot;
The [c=words ]words [/c](in the advertisment) were so [c= handsome 秀]handsome[/c], that they [k]enticed [/k]many to join the [p]dwarf[/p]'s [p]joga [/p]classes.
The fluid in the [c=hole 穴 ]holes [/c]in the ground must never [c= mix <span style="color:#0000ff;">串</span>]mix[/c]. For that reason the [p]ghostly dwarf[/p] [p]stands[/p] there to guard it all the time. But somehow - they mix, and a catastrophe is impending. He decides to [k]flee[/k].
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]started taking alchemy courses. But in order for the classes to be [c= just 义]just[/c], every student has to make his own [k]apparatus[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]instructor says that it's the [p]easy [/p]part.
Plese help my fixing my [c=clothing ]clothes[/c], I don't want to [c= endure (prohibited) 禁]endure [/c]laughter. I just need to fix the [k]lapel[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]takes it to the tailor, but suggests that you don't drink so much [p]jin [/p]next time.
The [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]was [c= dry 干]dry [/c]anyway so we made [k]poles [/k]from it. The [p]giant [/p]helps by moving another trees on a [p]gantry[/p].
He takes the [c= pitcher]pitcher[/c] with his [c=hand ]hands[/c] and [k]shakes[/k] it a little. Unfortunately, some of the precious content spills. The [p]fairy[/p] (in horror): &quot;[p]Yaow[/p]!&quot;
He had only put the [c=whiskey bottle ]whiskey bottle [/c]near his lips - [c= abrupt / sudden 卒]abruptly and suddenly [/c]- he was [k]drunk[/k]. You could only hear the [p]Zzzz. [/p]from the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p](that was supposed to guard the army camp) (it was a magical bottle).<br><img src="paste5sbhrf.jpg" />
The [c=heart 心 ]heart [/c]surgeon (in the middle of an operation) flips pages in a book - of [c= moon 月]moon [/c]photos -  with his [c= left 左 ]left hand[/c]. (His right hand holds the medical tools). He is obviously quite [k]lax[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p](supposed to guard the operation) guards only the [p]dollars [/p](that this operation costs).
As the group comes to the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave, [c= barbarians 夷]barbarians [/c]start running on them. &quot;[k]Eh?[/k] This won't be so [p]easy[/p] as I thought.&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]states.
The (pyrotechnical) [c=thread 糸 ]thread [/c]caused a lot of [c= trouble 娄]trouble[/c]: it still kept burning, producing a [k]number of wisps[/k] (of vapor). [p]Teddy [/p]runs into <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, and as he comes back a brings a [p]lurdiculous[/p] extinguisher.
The [c= dish]dish [/c]with [c=water ]water [/c]has been left in the [c= sun ]sun [/c]- to make it [k]lukewarm[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]says: &quot;It worked [p]once [/p]already. &quot;
The [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]was collected by [c= crawl 匍]crawling [/c]slaves in [k]Portugal[/k]. The [p]fairy[/p] felt sympathy with them and let them wash in her [p]pool[/p] afterwards.<br><br /><br>葡萄 - grapes
[c= only just 甫]Only just [/c]yesterday here was still [c=water ]water[/c], and now there is only [k]shore [/k]here. [p]Teddy [/p]drawn the water into his new [p]pool[/p].
(A hermitary.) He added a [c=door 户 ]door [/c]to the [c= mouth 口]mouth [/c]of the cave, because he wanted to become [k]enlightened[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]knocks on the door: &quot;Would you like some [p]cheese[/p]?&quot;
Looking at a [k]wrist[/k]-band, seeing a reflection of the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]- [c=???]windles [/c]- it's not a moon, but the [p]dwarf[/p]-missle in the mirror of dwarf's [p]wan[/p]).
(Weaving school) &quot;Why are you so [k]sluggish[/k], working with the [c=thread 糸 ]thread[/c]?&quot; She says nothing, but thinks: &quot;I'm in [c= love 爱]love[/c]. At least a left my [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]to guard that [p]Han[/p] (until I come).&quot;
[c=Harry ⺅ ]Harry [/c]was assigned to the [c= temple 寺]temple[/c], to [k]serve upon [/k]all people that want to go in. It was quite a peaceful work, until the [p]dwarf[/p]<span style="color:#0000ff;"> </span>ran in and started throwing [p]shallots[/p] everywhere.
In [c= asia 亚]Asia[/c], the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the [k]dumb [/k]people was sealed with [p]yarn[/p]. [p]Teddy [/p]got his mouth sealed too.<br><br>also onom: <span style="color:#ff0000;">哑 yā</span>
Her [c= husband 夫]husband [/c]though [c=moon 月 ]moon[/c]light might be best to see if her [k]skin [/k]was really white. Before that he asked the [p]giant [/p]to go out to get some [p]food[/p].<br><br />note: part-of-body 月 pronouced like 夫
The Romeo on the [c= sigh 乃]show sighs[/c] - &quot;What a beautiful [c=grain 禾 ]grain[/c]! &quot; The [p]two dwarfs[/p] greet the [k]handsome [/k]guests (of the [p]show[/p]).
He drunk the [c=whiskey bottle 酉 ]whiskey bottle [/c]alone, without giving a single [c= {inch 寸}]inch [/c]of it to the [k]senior [/k](sitting next to him). &quot;I was afraid he would infect the bottle with [p]zoons[/p]!&quot; the [p]giant [/p]explains.<br /><br />zoon = an indivudual in a colonial orgamnism.
He puts his [c= ear]ear [/c]on the [c=grass ]grass[/c] (to hear if somebody is coming). Then - he feels a [k]fluffy[/k] thing touching his ear (and stands up rapidly). The [p]fairy[/p] asks: &quot;What's [p]wrong[/p]?&quot;
They wanted them to [c= join together <span style="color:#ffaa00;">合</span>]join [/c]their [c=heart ]hearts together[/c]. And that's [k]exactly [/k]what happened: the [p]two dwarfs[/p] (man and woma) started dancing [p]cha-cha[/p].
It took some time to identify the [c= bird 鸟]bird[/c] they caught by the [c=river 江 ]river[/c]. It turned out to be an [k]eastern bean goose[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]then asks her if she wants to go back to [p]Hong [/p]Kong.
Earnest wanted to be a [c= heart 心]heart [/c]doctor [c=stubborn 艮 ]stubbornly[/c]. But he was not [k]earnest [/k]enough. [p]Teddy[/p]: &quot;The wordplays are beyond my [p]ken[/p].&quot;<br>(&quot;The importance of being Earnest&quot;)
A [c=small 小 ]small [/c]lamp has been put on a [c= pedestal 兀]pedestal [/c]- to serve as public [k]light[/k]. A [p]ghoslty giant [/p]guards it with his entire [p]gang[/p].
Give me a [c=hand ⺘]hand [/c]please to [c= contend 争]contend [/c]that my hand did not desert from the [k]struggle [/k](for a clear enviroment). I helped the [p]giant [/p]cleaning up the [p]jungle[/p].
The bird example has [c=not yet 未 ]not yet [/c]been [c= label]labelled[/c], but everybody could say what it is because of the [k]vermilion [/k]color. The [p]giant [/p]considers it one of the [p]jewels[/p] of the zoo.<br><br><img src="paste90am14.jpg" />
He comes out of the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of his cave. &quot;Tell me clearly what you [c= need 需]need[/c], stop [k]chattering[/k]!&quot; He then manages to explain the [p]fairy [/p]sent him for a [p]ruby[/p].
It was a quite hard [c= work 干]work [/c]to convert the simple [c=car 车 ]car [/c]into a [k]curtained carriage[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant[/p] (that will the guard the nobleman driving in it) gives advice from his [p]šanons[/p].
The aliens, that invaded the [c= city]city [/c]trought the [c=&quot;space gate&quot; 啚 ]space gate[/c], look a little like [k]rustic [/k]ppl (because they wear spades as weapons). The [p]Teddy[/p]<span style="color:#00aa00;"> </span>tries to offer them [p]beans [/p](to make peace with them).
He was paid only to [c= supervise 监]supervise [/c] [c=water ]water [/c](no other liquids) - but he supervised everything [k]indiscriminately[/k]. That's why he could catch the [p]dwarf [/p]with the [p]lantern [/p](trying to steal some whiskey).
The [k]chinese parasol tree [/k]is a [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]that is so high you can't believe it's [c= truly yours 吾]truly yours[/c]. Even the [p]fairy [/p]got [p]wounded [/p]as she tried to fly up there to the top.
The [c=slave 奴 ]slave [/c]brough a new [c= horse 马]horse [/c]to replace the [k]worn out old horses[/k]. The [p]fairy[/p] asks him then to cook her [p]noodles[/p].
(Troops training) They were very [k]strict [/k]on the [c=cliff 厂 ]cliff [/c]- a [c= thousand 万]thousand [/c]man had to move as one. The [p]dwarf [/p]passer-by only [p]leaps [/p]as they move around him.
A soldier tries to hit the [c= tree <span style="color:#0000ff;">木</span>]tree [/c]with his [c=spear <span style="color:#ffaa00;">矛</span> ]spear [/c](<span style="font-style:italic;">from above</span>)- suprised by the discovery that it is [k]flexible[/k]. It was the [p]fairy [/p]that casted a spell, to protect the tree from being taken to a [p]roast[/p].<br /><br />vs.: <span style="color:#0000ff;">杼</span> -  shuttle of a loom
&quot;Why are you [c=walk 走 ]walking [/c]around the [c= bookcase 且]bookcase [/c]like this?&quot; &quot;It seems [k]reclined [/k]to me.&quot; He then asks the [p]two dwarfs [/p]professionals to [p]check [/p]it.
The [c= winter 冬]winter [/c]is here, and [c=Harry ⺅ ]Harry [/c]ponders what present he could give to Mr. [k]Tong [/k]for Christmas. The [p]fairy [/p]suggests to give him some [p]tongs [/p](that would correspond with his name).
To [c=know 知 ]know [/c]the [c= sun 日]sun [/c]is up (and earth down) is a big [k]wisdom[/k]. But the [p]dwarf [/p]considers himself wise that he bathes in a [p]jacuzzi[/p].
At [c=daybreak 𠦝 ]daybreak[/c], you see a figure in [c= leather 韦<br>]leather [/c]armor. And it is [k]Han the Hero[/k]! The [p]fairy [/p]flies to inform the [p]Hans[/p], who are were happy.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]wanted all his [c= tool 具]tools [/c]<span style="font-style:italic;">entirely </span>clean, [k]without exception[/k]. That why he was angry to discover that the [p]dwarf [/p]spoiled some [p]juice [/p]on his favorite hammer (and didn't even bother cleaning it up!). He went to get him (even though it was <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>).
[c= straight 直]Straight [/c]away after buying his new computer, right after connecting to the (inter)[c=net 罒 ]net[/c], he started [k]installing[/k] (some games). The [p]dwarf [/p]wants to play while sitting in the [p]jacuzzi[/p].
He was almost at the top of the [c=mountain 山 ]mountain [/c]but then he [c= hesitate 夋]hesitates[/c]. Is the mountain not too [k]harsh[/k]? The [p]dwarfs [/p]sends a [p]žuna [/p]to push him to the top (he doesn't want his team to lose).
&quot;What is the most useful [c= insect 虫]insect [/c]under [c=heaven 天 ]heaven[/c]? The [k]silkworm [/k]- because he produces silk.&quot; he proclaims. The [p]fairy [/p]flies away as she can't [p]stand [/p]worms, not even silkworms.
She is eating [c=grass 艹 ]grass[/c], and no matter what kind of [c= sentence 句]sentences [/c]you tell, she seems to remain [k]careless[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]asks you to be patient as it is just a [p]goat[/p].
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]is standing by a [c= fire <span style="color:#00aa00;">火</span>]fire[/c], and has to greet many [k]groups of people[/k]. One group brought a kid that played with the fire, and now the [p]ghostly Teddy [/p](supposed to guard the fire) has to douse the fires everywhere with his [p]hoses[/p].
The list contained mostly [c= generic weapons 戎]generic weapons[/c] - the most suspicious thing was some kind of [c=thread ⺰]thread[/c]. It looked torn [k]velvet[/k]. The [p]fairy[/p] suspects something is [p]wrong[/p] here.
&quot;They arrived at the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of cave. I have the feeling as we here already [c= were (archaic final past) 矣]were[/c]?&quot; His companion [k]grunts [/k](in agreement). It's the [p]giants [/p]cave, but he says: &quot;[p]Ai[/p], I have forgotten my keys!&quot;
They wanted to check if the [c= dagger 戈<br>]dagger [/c]changed to a [k]halberd [/k]at [c=daybreak 𠦝 ]daybreak[/c]. The [p]Teddy[/p] drove there in a [p]jeep [/p](and found out it didn't...)
(<span style="font-style:italic;">a SE Asian climbing plant with long thin strong stems used especially for making furniture</span>)<br />In a grass trading project, you trade your [c=grass 草 ]grass [/c]for some [k]rattan [/k]from the [c= Teng 腾]Teng [/c]county. The [p]fairy [/p]flies to [p]Teng [/p]and back with the shipment.
The condemned was [k]punished [/k]- he has been <span style="font-style:italic;">put to death</span>. He recieved the [c=words ]words [/c]in [c= vermilion <span style="color:#ff0000;">朱</span>]vermilion [/c]colors. The [p]giant [/p]takes him to the [p]jukebox [/p](he must hear music until his head explodes).
The [c= pigeon 隹]pigeon[/c] wants to fly up a [c=mountain 山 ]mountain[/c]. But it's a [k]high mountain[/k]. So he asks the [p]ghostly giant[/p]: &quot;Could you guard me from falling, and keep [p]statistics [/p]of my speed?&quot;
He's [c= &quot;write with brush&quot; <span style="color:#0000ff;">聿</span>]writing with the brush [/c]- but he's out of ink, so he uses [c=water ]water [/c]with [k]saliva [/k]instead. The [p]giant [/p]offer him his [p]jin [/p]instead (but neither works very well, obviously).<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">津津</span> - enthusiastic
The [c=fish 鱼 ]fish [/c]found it funny to [c= beat a drum 咢]beat a drum [/c](that fell underwater) - unfortunately it attracted a [k]crocodile[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p](bathing there) feels an [p]urgent [/p]need (to get out of the water).
The only way to cure the [c=illness ]illness [/c]was to open his stomach with a door [c= handle 巴]handle[/c]. That left a huge [k]cicatrix [/k]over his belly. The [p]giant [/p]is afraid buying the [p]bargains [/p]was not such a good idea.
(In the woods, about to make an axe.) He examines the [c=tree 木 ]trees [/c]one by one but not before he came to the [c= third 丙]third [/c]tree took he it for a [k]shaft [/k](of his new axe). [p]Teddy [/p](bored, happy that it was only the third one, not the thirtyieth one): &quot;[p]Bingo[/p]!&quot;
A [c= &quot;vacation-part&quot; 叚]part of the vacation [/c]was unfortunately tainted by [c=rain ⻗ ]rain [/c]- but at least they could watch the [k]red clouds [/k]in the evening (from inside of the hotel). The rest of the vacation the drive on the [p]sharks [/p]- an attraction hosted by the [p]two fairies[/p].
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]suggets: Let's go a little in this [c= direction 方]direction[/c]. Why not? It can't [k]harm[/k]. It's the direction where the [p]fairy [/p]sent [p]Fang [/p]the dog.
Your [c=house ]house [/c]got recenlty [c= abundant 丰 ]abundant [/c]with talking [c= mouth　口]mouths[/c]! What a [k]calamity[/k]! But fortunately, (after much quarell) the [p]dwarf [/p]let's you sleep in his [p]hay[/p].
They tries to move the [c=swine 豕 ]swine[/c], they [c= strike 殳]strike [/c]and strike it, but it's just [c= stand 立 ]stands[/c].  The [p]dwarf [/p]murmurs: &quot;It's [k]firm and resolute[/k]. It won't be [p]easy[/p].&quot;
The soldier took his [k]soldier's pay [/k]and walked [c= towards 向]towards [/c]the [c=food ]food [/c]canteen... Today the [p]two Teddies [/p]from [p]Shanghai [/p]cook their legendary dishes.
Everybody wanted to see the [k]legendary wolf[/k], but the only one, who didn't return <span style="font-style:italic;">wretched</span>, brought a [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]covered with [c=???]seashells [/c](he was trying to fake the legendary wolf). The [p]dwarf [/p]puts food outside everyday, hoping to attract the wolf to the [p]bacon[/p].
He cut a [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]to produce a [k]sculling oar[/k], unfortunately he was too [c= crass 鲁]crass [/c]be able to do it. [p]Teddy [/p]brings in some [p]loops[/p] (as help for the boat).
He [c= stubborn]stubbornly [/c]insisted on going to the [p]hunt[/p], altough he was [c=illness 疒 ]ill[/c]. As he returned, the [p]fairy [/p]says: &quot;Not only you are still ill, you also have terrible [k]scares[/k]!&quot;
If I cut out the [c=grass 艹 ]grass[/c], and plant [k]garlic [/k]instead.... he [c=???]rationalized[/c]. But the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p](guarding the desert garden) thinks it's unlikely the garlic would grow on [p]sand[/p].
Try giving some [c= grain 禾]grain [/c]to the [c=fish 鱼 ]fish[/c], perhaps it will [k]revive [/k]it. But the [p]giant [/p]thinks it would be better to buy some fresh water from the [p]supermarket[/p].
She [k]rubs [/k]the [c=hemp 麻 ]hemp [/c]in her [c= hand 手]hand[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]tries to convince her: &quot;If you would give up drugs, you could soon be a top [p]model[/p].&quot;
The [c=king 王 ]king [/c]is willing to go up even the [c= high mountain 崔]high mountain [/c]- he heard there is a very [k]resplendent [/k]gem there he wants to see. The [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]guards his path, and keeps [p]statistics [/p]of how many times per minute he stumbles.
The [c=water 水 ]water [/c]claimed the be [c= original 原]original[/c], but it was of unknown [k]origin[/k]. But the [p]fairy [/p]doesn't care, she offers one [p]yuan [/p]coin for a bottle.
He [c= handshake 又]handshakes [/c]with the seller and jumps on the [c=horse 马 ]horse[/c]. He hopes he manages to [k]steer [/k]it well. But the horse got distracted by a [p]dwarf [/p]playing [p]ukulele[/p] (and it was <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, so he was nervous - and ran wild).
The [c=stone 石 ]stone [/c]you found in the [c= shelter 广]shelter [/c]is a piece of [k]ore[/k]. Give it to the [p]dwarf [/p]guarding the storage room, who will give you a [p]cangaroo [/p]in return.
His [c=two hands 开 ]two hands [/c]were held in front of him, and cut away with a [c= knife 刀]knife[/c]. A pretty tough [k]punishment[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]says: &quot;Well, it's still better that being stoned to death by [p]shingles[/p].&quot;
This particular [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]did enjoy his [c= sunny]sunny [/c]place. It might be because it was a [k]poplar[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]planted it here as a memorial of the [p]Yankees[/p].
As he enters, he takes his [c= berret]berret [/c]with [c=two hands 廾　]two hands[/c], and [k]raises [/k]it. The [p]giant [/p]has already learned this strange custom of this [p]Schenke[/p].
He founds &quot;something&quot; in the [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c](and it is not very odoriferous). &quot;This is the [c= direction 方]direction[/c], throught these [k]odoriferous [/k]flowers [p]Fang [/p]the dog ran.&quot; the [p]giant [/p]deduces.
When the [c=house 宀 ]house [/c]was to be turned into the president's [k]residence[/k], even the [c=???]blades of grass [/c](in the garden before the house) had to be cut to equal height. The [p]fairy [/p]helps with preparing a presidental [p]čaj[/p].
It's [c= not 不]not [/c]the [c=king 王 ]king[/c]. He doesn't have the royal [k]ring[/k]. The [p]ghostly fairy [/p](guarding the king's private quarters): &quot;[p]Hands [/p]up, intruder!&quot;
The [c= page 页]page [/c](of sweet edible paper) was on my [c=spoon 匕 ]spoon [/c]only for [k]a short while[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]rescues it and hid it in a [p]chink[/p], so that it won't be eaten.
It was the [c= fifth 戊]fifth [/c]generation of the [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]that grew [k]luxuriant[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]thinks it might be because he killed all the [p]mouses[/p].
An [c=ox-in-yoke ]ox-in-yoke[/c] is working. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]is guarding him. The ox-in-yoke asks him: Could you do me a [k]favor[/k]? Please turn off the [p]hifi[/p], the love songs are tearing my [c= heart 心]heart[/c].<br />ox-in-yoke = 專 ohne 寸
The [c=mountain spring 氿 ]mounatin spring [/c]was needed to water the [c= tree 木]tree [/c]- but it was [k]contaminated[/k]! [p]Teddy [/p]demands [p]ransom [/p]for the clean water (he contaminated it to get some money).
Even though the [c=illness 疒 ]illness [/c]he caught there was already healed before a [c= long time 久]long time[/c], he still feels [k]remorse [/k]for going there. Maybe it's because the [p]two dwarfs [/p]still like to make [p]jokes [/p]about it.
The [c=horse 马 ]horse [/c]was too big to pass through the [c= door 户]door[/c]. &quot;Get at least the  [k]donkey [/k]here!&quot; (He will hopefulyl pass through.) The [p]fairy [/p]thinks it is [p]lurdiculous [/p]to move animals inside (even in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>).
(Esteem gaining competition.) If you want to gain [c= esteem 尚]esteem [/c]by [c=walk 走 ]walking[/c], you have to walk a [k]number of trips[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]gets [p]tangled[/p], tring to walk too high nubmer of trips.<br /><img src="paste3akz4e.jpg" />
Your [c= younger brother (弟)]younger brother [/c]wants to climb on a [c=tree ]tree[/c] - the [p]giant [/p]brings him a [k]ladder[/k]. &quot;[p]Team[/p]-work is better than solo-work!&quot;
Since the [c=pit 凵 ]pit [/c]was full of [c= water 水 ]water[/c], it did hinder the [c= transition 了]transition [/c]of the post car. As it the car stopped, some [k]envelopes [/k]flew out. The [p]fairy [/p]thinks one should hire some [p]Han [/p]people instead of the car.
After unsuccessfully trying to mix things up with a [c= stick ]stick[/c], they suggest a [c=mortar 臼 ]mortar[/c]. He is so pleased by the idea that he [c= handshake 又]handshakes [/c]with everybody around. Eh, it's really an [k]old gentleman[/k]. Unfortunately, he can't handshake with [p]Teddy[/p], because he has a [p]soda [/p]in both his paws.
Petr [k]Pan[/k] sinks in the [c=water ]water[/c], time after [c= a time]time[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]finds this story boring and thinks of food fried on a [p]pan [/p]instead.
He [c= {to stand 立}]stands [/c]on a [c=rice 米 ]rice [/c]sack (and unfortunately breaks a hole, and it starts falling out). &quot;What is exact [k]number of grains[/k]?&quot; the [p]dwarf [/p]asks, &quot;How many have [p]leaked[/p]?&quot;
&quot;Why do you want to return to the [c=moon 月 ]moon[/c]?&quot; &quot;[c= because 因]Because[/c]... I forgot my [k]rouge [/k]there.&quot; But the [p]giant [/p]has no understanding for it - and certainly has no [p]yen [/p]to turn the ship back.
He tried if a even a [c=smallest 幺 ]smallest [/c]cable can be used as an (electrical) [c= power 力]power [/c]conductor. Too bad he died so [k]young[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]says: &quot;Even when I was young, I was not so stupid as this [p]yokel[/p].&quot;
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]went [c= straight 直]straight [/c]to work, to show, that he is [k]worth [/k]it. The [p]fairy [/p]decided to have a bath in the [p]jacuzzi [/p]first.
He was supported to [c= watch over (译 without 讠)]watch over [/c]the cats, but they are gone! Only [c=claw marks 釆 ]claw marks [/c]are left over. &quot;You'll have to [k]explain [/k]that!&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p]was busy eating [p]shallots [/p](and didn't watch, so they fled).
&quot;I thought the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]is [c= distant from 离]distant from [/c]here. How is it possible, that it [k]seeps [/k]through?&quot; The [p]fairy [/p]had to [p]leap [/p]as her feet got wet (by the seeping water).
It the [c= old days 昔]old days[/c], even the emperors had to [k]plough [/k]their fields with [c=???]plows[/c]... The [p]fairy [/p]says you should be happy that today you can use [p]jeeps[/p].
So, now I'm going to [c=wrap 勹 ]wrap [/c]him up and throw into a [p]pool[/p], the [p]fairy[/p] plans. &quot;Where is he, he was here [c= just now 甫]just now[/c]?&quot; But he [k]crawled[/k] away into safety just a moment ago.
This [k]ointment[/k] can be made only when the [c= moon]moon[/c] is very [c=high 高 ]high[/c]. The [p]giant[/p], however, dislikes it as the smell reminds him of the time he had [p]gout[/p].
After the [c= catamaran 俞]catamaran[/c] (I mean arc) will be finished, enter it after [c=words ]words [/c]appear on it - it will be the [k]order from above [/k]to board. But before leaving have the [p]dwarf [/p]read the [p]eulogy[/p].
The pig was a [c= shackled pig 豖]shackled pig [/c]but they didn't shackle his [c=mouth ]mouth[/c]. And the chicken get angry (because of his bad speech) and start [k]pecking [/k]him! The [p]ghostly fairy [/p]flies by and says that it is a bad [p]joke[/p].
After dropping some magical [c= ash 灰]ashes [/c]on the [c=heart ]heart[/c], it [k]restores[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant[/p], guarding the heart, turns his [p]hi[/p]-fi on (to keep the beating up).
The [c=kid 子 ]kid [/c]is [k]lone[/k], walking around the street - the only thing he has is a [c= melon 瓜]melon[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]sends him his [p]goose [/p](so that he has at least some company).
As he came on the [c=mound ]mound[/c], he [c= stubborn 艮]stubbornly [/c]insisted on going on further, even though he knew he reached the [k]limit[/k]. The one of the [p]two dwarfs [/p]had to show him in the [p]šanons[/p] how much it would cost him (then he gave in).
He started [c= division 分]dividing [/c]the [c=rice 米 ]rice [/c]- until only [k]powder [/k]was left. [p]Teddy [/p]findes it [p]fun[/p].
The [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]has been genetically modified to grow in [c= dual 耦]dual mode[/c]: It has a [k]root of lotus[/k] (so it can grow both on land and on water). [p]Teddy [/p]tramples over it as he is catching [p]ouzels[/p].
He takes a [c=drum 壴 ]drum [/c]- since he lost his stick he just takes a [c= branch 支]branch [/c]and starts [k]to drum[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]wants to train his [p]goose [/p]to be able to do that too.
You could see all kinds of [c= grass 艹]grass [/c]in the garden - their owners were care[c=-less 无 ]less[/c]. The garden was [k]overgrown with weeds[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]says it [p]woundes [/p]her feeling to see it.
The pupils had to smell various [c=fragrant 香 ]fragrant [/c]things, and [c= {repeat 复}]repeat [/c]it, until they learned every singly [k]scent[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]watching it thinks it is a good job to be [p]food [/p]teacher.
Every time the castle park [c= {benefit 益}]benefited[/c], [c=water ]water [/c]was added to the fountain. Soon it startes [k]overflowing[/k]. Dwarf is bad mooded, as he will have to drink all the overflowing water: &quot;It won't be [p]easy[/p]&quot;, says the [p]dwarf[/p].
Who ist the [c= old gentleman 叟]old gentleman[/c]? And the [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]next to him? It is my [k]older brother's wife[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]says he first thought it was the [p]Salo[/p].
They wanted to [c= combine 合]combine [/c]two types of [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]in a single lawn. They hoped everybody would [k]agree[/k]. But the [p]fairy [/p]sabotaged it in the [p]dark[/p].
(Giving directions in Morrowind): When you see a [c= ravine (船 without 舟 )]ravine [/c]with [c=water ]water[/c], go [k]along [/k]it (if you see some ravines without water, you can go over it). The [p]fairy [/p]has [p]yan[/p] to accompany you.
Fortunately, the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]was shining bright enought for them to notice the trap. If they would walk just an [c= inch 寸]inch [/c]more, they would stumble, perhaps breaknig an [k]elbow[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]thinks it was a bad [p]joke[/p].
(In a totalitary system, he wrote a dangerous article.) He jumps into the [c=car 车 ]car[/c], and hears a [c= whisper 咠]whisper[/c]. &quot;Let's go to the office to [k]edit [/k]the article,&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]whispers, &quot;you can drive the [p]jeep[/p].&quot;
The probably came to [c= add 加]add [/c]new power connections. You can see them on the [c=road 辶 ]road[/c] towards the house of [k]Ťjá[/k] (Ťaťána). The [p]two giants [/p]put down all the [p]jars [/p](before ringing the doorbell).
He threw some [c= seashell]seashells [/c]among the [c=plants ]plants[/c]. Some [k]energetic [/k]pills are contained there (it works as a fertilizer). The resulting plants are extremly big - only the [p]giant [/p]is able to [p]bend[/p] them.
You remember that during the [c=auspicious 吉 ]auspicious [/c]days the one called [k]Yuan [/k]wore a [c= skirt]skirt[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]asks why don't you send her some [p]Yuan [/p]coins.
It was quite quiet in the class, until, [k]unexpectedly[/k], a [c=sound 音 ]sound [/c](of a talking) could be heard from a [c= boy 儿]boy[/c]. The [p]dwarf [/p]teacher [p]jingles [/p]a bell - to restore discipline.
Your [k]uncle [/k]has crawled [c=above ]above[/c] - very high - to [c= shake hands ]shake hands [/c]with the [p]giant[/p]. (he had to crawl so high in order to reach it at all - otherwise he would just see his [p]shoes[/p], because he is so [c= small]small[/c]!)
The [c=house ]house[/c] [c= uncle 叔]uncle[/c] lives in a [k]solitary [/k]house. He is happy that at least the [p]dwarf [/p]comes sometimes in his [p]jeep[/p].
The [c=horse 马 ]horse [/c]likes running around the [c= area 区]area[/c], unfortunatelly there is already somebody <span style="font-style:italic;">urging </span>to [k]expel [/k]him, even though it is <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>. The [p]giant [/p]needs this area for his [p]chewing gums [/p]factory.
This [c= bead 朱]bead [/c]is [k]unique[/k]. Unfortunately it has caused a lot of [c=evil 歹 ]evil[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]hides it in his [p]shoe[/p], so it can't cause more evil now.
They all dropped the [c= page 页]page [/c](from above). The legend was that the most [c=auspicious 吉 ]auspicious [/c]pair's page would [k]fly upwards[/k]. Actually, a page gets caught by the the [p]two fairies [/p](that have just left their [p]shack[/p]) and flies with them upwards.
Whoever can [k]bend [/k]this [c= bow 弓]bow [/c]is a good ender (next to Bender) [c=???]as well. [/c]The [p]giant [/p]is certainly one - he can bend even a [p]wan[/p].
Correct, it's [c=rain ]rain[/c]. According to the [k]thunder trigram[/k], a [c=???]heavenly body [/c]should fly nearby soon - that's what the [p]dwarf [/p]understood in [p]Geneva[/p].
He holds it's [c= tongue]tongue [/c]with his [c=hand ]hand [/c](hoping he won't get bitted) - he wants to [k]include [/k]it in his animal collection. But the [p]ghostly dwarf[/p], guarding the animal stops him: &quot;Halt! I'm guarding this [p]koala[/p]!&quot;<br /><br /><br />实词包括名词、动词、助动词、形容词、数词、量词和代词七类。
The [c= bird 隹]bird [/c](a parrot) had to had his [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]tied up - because he was only repeating &quot;Avian-ism forever!&quot; [k]exclusively[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]is about to reeducate him: &quot;Just you [p]wait[/p]!&quot;
The [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]is supposed to guard the [p]tower[/p], but he's bored, so he hungs himself with his toes on a [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c], his head supported by the [c= &quot;dom&quot;]dom [/c]walls, is ghostly body building an [k]ellipse [/k]that way.<br /><br />mound + have 有 = &quot;dom&quot;. This mound is happy - it has even a &quot;dom&quot; built on it.<br /><br />neplést: 随
It was [c= winter 冬]winter[/c], you could see only some frozen [c=thread 糸　]threads [/c](that were probably clothes sometimes) flying in the cold polar wind. It looked like the [k]end [/k](of the world) came. To improve the looks at a least a little, the [p]giant [/p]planted a [p]jonquil [/p]there (hopefully it won't freeze).
He [c=right hand 又 ]shakes hand [/c]with the [c= earth 土]earth [/c](with the dead person in a grave). &quot;I want to be [k]holy[/k], I will no more go into the [p]Schenke[/p].&quot; the [p]dwarf [/p]promises.
The [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]attacked the [c= king 王]king[/c], because it was a [k]wild [/k]dog. The [p]ghostly fairy [/p](guarding the king) summons a [p]kangaroo [/p]to defend him.
The [c=words 言　]words [/c]that he showed he was [c= upright 正]upright [/c]- it was a [k]certificate[/k]. But they still aren't sure as it was written by a [p]dwarf [/p]in the [p]jungle[/p].
&quot;In [k]ten days[/k], the [c= sun 日]sun [/c]will be [c=???]wrapped [/c]and will fall down!&quot; says the doompreacher. &quot;It's [p]šunt[/p], and it's <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span> on your brain.&quot; answers him the [p]fairy[/p].
The [c=road ]road [/c]was reserved for [c= an official 官]an official[/c]: in case he had to [k]escape from [/k]his residence. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guarding the road is a loyal servant of the [p]Hans[/p].
The [c=king 王 ]king [/c]notices [c= nail 丁]nails [/c]flying around him and in the distance some kind of [k]tinkling[/k]. He feels scared, so he calls a [p]giant [/p]to pick him up with a [p]dinghy[/p].
Did a [c= ghost 鬼]ghost [/c]take your [c=heart ]heart [/c](are you in love with a ghost)? You should be [k]ashamed_2[/k]. And the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]is just a [p]kid[/p].
&quot;Tell me [c=right away 就 ]right away [/c]what [c= bird 鸟]bird [/c]that is!&quot; &quot;A... [k]black eagle[/k]?&quot; &quot;That was right, but not right away!&quot; It's no [p]joking [/p]with the [p]two dwarfs[/p].
If the [c=water ]water [/c]wants to have a comparatively [c= longetivity 寿]long life[/c], it has to make [k]big waves [/k]- the ones the [p]giant [/p]likes to wash his [p]tower [/p]with.
The [c= old gentleman 叟]old gentleman [/c]was very sensitive to the [c=wind 风 ]wind[/c], he jumped out at every [k]sough[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]tries to help him with some [p]soda[/p].
The [c=door 户 ]door [/c]was open a little, so, that the [c= moon 月]moon [/c]shined on his [k]shoulder [/k]only. The second of the [p]two giants [/p]is trying to fix the [p]generator [/p](outside) (so that light goes up again).
He was looking for some [c=shelter ]shelter[/c], where he could [c= settle down 氐]settle down[/c]. He found some free space at the [k]bottom [/k](of a hill). The only problem is that [p]Teddy [/p]confiscated some [p]deeds [/p]for himself.
He has the [c= intention 志]intention [/c]to remove all what could be the cause of the [c=illness 疒 ]ilness[/c]. The next step means removing all the [k]birthmarks[/k] from his body. The [p]dwarf [/p]murmles as he doesn't want pay him that, and asks, if washing in a [p]jacuzzi [/p]regulary would not be enough.
At the climbing event, the wall [c= resemble 肖]resembles[/c] a [c=mountain 山 ]mountain[/c] - it's so [k]high and steep[/k]. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]chefs are cooking a [p]chowder [/p]for the participants.
There was an atmosphere of [c=trust 孚 ]trust [/c]at that home, as the mother was <span style="font-style:italic;">milking</span> the child (with her [k]breast[/k] obviously). The only strange thing was a [c= hook 乚]hook [/c]sticking from a wall, so [p]Teddy [/p]hooks a [p]ruby[/p] there.
They managed to modify the [c= steroid nucleus 甾]steroid nucleus [/c]of the silkworm. And as a result, the [c=thread 糸 ]thread [/c]he produced of pure [k]black silk[/k]! The [p]giant [/p]working in the factory unfortunately didn't see the first results, all you could hear from him was [p]Z..Z..Zzz[/p].  (Cool pseudochemisty btw., huh?)
He puts his [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]close to her [c= ear 耳]ear[/c], and whispers her a sweet secret. He [k]whispers[/k]: &quot;Tonight...the [p]dwarf [/p]will bring us a [p]cheese[/p].&quot;
What is it? [c= it 它]It[/c]? It is a [c=horse 马 ]horse[/c]. But it is [k]hunchbacked [/k]like a <span style="font-style:italic;">camel</span>! But that is because the [p]ghostly fairy[/p] forgot to guard the [p]tower [/p](and he crashed into it - since then he is hunchbacked).
A confused priest instructes the giant: &quot;The [c=claw marks 釆 ]claw marks [/c]should teach you that you should distinguish[c= heart 心] [/c]what's in your [k]heart in all cases[/k]. For example, when you are shaving [p]sheeps[/p], what's in your heart?&quot; &quot;Lust for sheep meat.&quot; the [p]giant [/p]answers.
The [c=mountain 山 ]mountain [/c]was covering the [k]bank[/k], so it was a [c= &quot;covered cliff&quot; 厈]covered cliff[/c]. The [p]dwarf[/p] didn't like it so he decided to clean it away with his [p]anchor[/p].
He has to go over a bridge - made of pipes. He takes a [c=step forward 彳 ]step forward[/c], but one of the pipes [c= un- 非]un-[/c]bind and breaks. So he remains standing, [k]irresolute[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]whispers: &quot;The other [p]pipes [/p]are ok, don't worry, just go.&quot;
As he puts his [c=foot 足 ]foot [/c]into the [c= barn 仓]barn[/c], he starts to [k]sway from side to side[/k] (he just can't stand right on stinking hay). The [p]two dwarfs [/p]would laugh at him if it were not Mr. [p]Chang[/p] himself.
His [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]has been [c= seal 卩]sealed[/c], so he can only communicate throught [k]knocking [/k](or <span style="font-style:italic;">kowtowing</span>). The [p]dwarf [/p]laughs and says: &quot;If you [p]kowtow[/p] to me, I will unseal it again.&quot;
&quot;Hej, [c=Harry ]Harry[/c]! Give the [c= mortar]mortar [/c]here!&quot; &quot;Just [k]a moment[/k]! I'll just pulverize the [p]uranium [/p]for the [p]fairy [/p](she needs wants be shining in the <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>).&quot;
He thought he could fill in the pit by throwing in enough [c=earth 土　]earth[/c], but it turned out that he was [c= overbearing 亢]overbering[/c] - the [k]pit [/k]was very deep. The [p]giant [/p]says: &quot;He's just an overbearing [p]kenkel.[/p]&quot; (And steps over the pit with one big step.)
&quot;Don't [c= spit 咅]spit [/c]here, on the [c=grass ]grass[/c], it is rumored that a [k]Bodhisattva [/k]used to walk here.&quot; However, the true reason is that the [p]fairy [/p]wants to station her [p]pool [/p]there (and she wants no spits under the pool).
The [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]was [c= with no clear boundary 汒]with no clear boundary[/c], or with other words, [k]boundless[/k]. The [p]fairy[/p] thinks the one who will have to mower it will get pretty [p]mangled[/p].
The [c= moon 月]moon [/c]reflects on the [c=&quot;infinite mirror&quot; ]infinite mirror [/c]- but at the very front, a [k]bone[/k] is placed - as a memento mori. The [p]Teddy[/p] says: Even [p]gooses[/p] have to die.
These [c=words ]words [/c]were written by the [c= general 普]general[/c]! It describes the [k]layout [/k]of the troops tomorrow. But [p]Teddy [/p]didn't see it as he was diving in the [p]pool[/p].
Even though he looks very [c= tired 乏]tired[/c], he still moves his [c=eye 目 ]eye [/c]to you and [k]blinks [/k]friendly. But [p]Teddy [/p]is not tired and [p]jumps [/p]around happily.
The [c=guest ]guest [/c]sticks the [c= page]page[/c] to this [k]forehead[/k]. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; The [p]fairy[/p]'s only answer is &quot;[p]eeee....[/p]&quot; (obviously getting insane). (btw. guest pages on various websites contain often similiary intelligent answers - you have the need to knock your forehead reading them)
The [c=king 王 ]king [/c]was very interested in the [c= booklet 册]booklet [/c]- about [k]corals[/k]. The [p]giant[/p] offers to take him to see some coral reefs - just after he packs some [p]shandy[/p][p] [/p]with him.
[c=several 几 ]Several [/c]of the [k]long-cherished [/k]people were actually very [c= evil 歹]evil[/c]. Fortunately it was discovered <span style="font-style:italic;">early </span>enough. They were even forcing the [p]dwarf [/p]to steal in the [p]supermarket[/p].
He looked [k]bleak [/k]when he noticed his [c=  wife 妻]wife [/c]lying in the [c=ice 冫 ]ice[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]tries to console him with some (frozen) [p]cheese[/p].
They admire themselves [c= mutually 相]mutually [/c]so long that the are only able to get a room on the side (a [k]side room[/k]). But they don't mind - it has a nice view to the [c=cliff 厂 ]cliff[/c]. And the [p]two giants [/p]from [p]Shanghai [/p]have never seen cliffs like that.
&quot;It is like [c=mound ]mound[/c], but it is near the river. What it is [c= it 它]it[/c]? &quot;A [k]steep bank[/k]?&quot; &quot;Actually, it is a [p]tower [/p]guarded by the [p]ghostly fairy [/p](and changed look like a steep river bank).
The [c= city]city [/c]seemed to [c=have 有　]have [/c]something - like an atmosphere of [k]melancholy[/k]. You suspect it is caused by the [p]dwarf [/p]playing [p]ukulele [/p]in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>.
The [c= marquis 侯]marquis [/c]almost made it inside the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave: but he stepped on a trap, and something hit his [k]larynx[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]transports his paralysed body back to the [p]hotel[/p].
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]plays with the [c= dagger 戈]dagger[/c]: &quot;I don't want to [k]boast[/k], but I can <span style="font-style:italic;">attack </span>any level creatures. &quot; But the [p]fairy [/p]doesn't seem to care, she just waves her [p]fan[/p].
He tries to [c= go]go[/c], but a [c=net ]net[/c] flies over him - he is caught, he has to [k]cease[/k] moving. The [p]dwarf [/p]says, [p]bad[/p]<span style="color:#0000ff;"> </span>luck, <span style="font-weight:600; font-style:italic;">heh</span>?
They pretented to go for a [c=walk ]walk [/c]to find the [c= shears]shears [/c]- but instead they fled to the [k]Zhao state[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]takes his [p]jousting[/p] equimpent and goes purse them.
Give me a [c=hand ]hand [/c]- I [c= receive 受]recieved [/c]a lot of books, I have to use them to give a [k]lecture[/k]. After the lecture the [p]dwarf [/p]will come up with his [p]show[/p].
His home was situated [c= between 介]between [/c]two [c=mound ⻖ ]mounds[/c], causing the [k]stairs [/k]in between them look even more magnificent. The feast begins by the [p]two giants [/p]carring a (giant) [p]jelly [/p]cake stepping up the stairs.
The started [c= inundate 氾]inundating [/c]the [c=grass ]grass[/c], in hope to produce some good enough to be used as a [k]specimen[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]waves then a [p]fan [/p]over it to simulate wind.<br /><img src="paste9wU6Hl.jpg" />
She [k]rued [/k]her evil actions in the [c= old days 昔]old days[/c]. Broken hearts (that's what she [k]rued [/k]most), [p]sheeps [/p]stolen from the [p]giant[/p]...
They had a problem above on a [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]- they couldn't level the game [c= level 平]board[/c]. The kids wanted to play a [k]chess-like game[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]gave them [p]ping [/p]pong balls to play with instead (she didn't like them being on a tree).
(The evil mage says:) I'll [c= add 加]add [/c]something to your [c=illness 疒 ]illness[/c]: you'll get [k]scabs [/k]from now on, too. The [p]two giants [/p]bring in some [p]jars [/p](with medicine against scabs).
The [c=container 匚 ]container [/c]was suspicious. [c= as/if 若]As if [/c]somebody was [k]skulking [/k]behind it. As you look there, you scare the [p]dwarf [/p]so, that he hits his [p]knee [/p](trying to flee).
&quot;I wanted to go into the [c=mouth ]mouth [/c]of cave, but it [c= stink 臭]stinks [/c]terribly. Any idea what [k]smell [/k]is that?&quot; &quot;It seems the [p]two dwarfs [/p]did play a terrible [p]show [/p]agan.&quot; (with animal killing and smashing the organs all around the cave).
The [k]Ji [/k]family is called so because it used to dress [c=???]unicorns [/c]in jeans - so that they won't get their legs dirty while eating the [c=grain stalks ]grain stalks[/c]. In modern times, they send the [p]giant [/p]to bring the stalks by a [p]jeep [/p](so the unicorn doesn't have to bother going to the fields anymore).
So, [c= hunderd 百]hunderd [/c]feet from the [c=mound ⻖]mound [/c]would a [k]boundary path [/k]look nice. The [p]dwarf [/p]is shaping a [p]model [/p]of a new town.
The [c= woman 女]woman [/c]comes to [c=see 贝 ]see [/c]the [k]baby[/k], and the comes to [c=see 贝 ]see [/c]it again. The [p]giant [/p]helps [p]Ying [/p]by make some shopping for the baby (looking funny being so big and buying so small things).
In the [c=tent ]tent [/c]he noticed [c= Harry ]Harry[/c], than [c= Harry ]Harry[/c]... There was a [k]multitude [/k]of Harries in the tent. The [p]dwarf [/p]marks the boss Harry with a [p]jonquil [/p](so that everybody can see him).
Did you ever try to press [p]curd[/p] from a [c=stone ]stone[/c]? [c= why not 盍]Why not?[/c] The [p]giant [/p]can teach you that. &quot;You just have take some stones and [k]knock [/k]them really hard.&quot;
&quot;If you want to see the [c=moon <span style="color:#0000ff;">月</span> ]moon[/c], you have to wait until [c= night <span style="color:#0000ff;">夜</span>]night [/c](till it's dark).&quot; &quot;If you want to see something really dark, look at the [p]yetti[/p]'s [k]armpit[/k].&quot; [p]dwarf[/p] the skeptic suggests.
Their [c=bone 骨 ]bone [/c]collection was in [c= trouble 娄]trouble[/c]: the [k]skull [/k]got lost! The [p]fairy [/p]took it to decorate her [p]lounge[/p].
They are suprised to find a [c=bone 骨 ]bone [/c]on the road. It's probably a part of the [k]bones of the body [/k]of the [c= pig 亥]pig [/c]that got run over a car yesterady. The [p]fairy [/p]took the bones and put it to rest in the pig's cemetery [p]hay[/p].
He tries selling a (cow) [k]lung [/k]as a stone from the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]on the [c= market 市]market[/c]. The [p]dwarf [/p]got soon [p]famous [/p]for this trick.
You notice a [c= handle 巴]handle [/c]hanging inside the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of a cave. This was supposed to be a new [k]settlement[/k]. However, the [p]dwarf [/p]had stolen all the [p]easels [/p](with the plans; so they didn't get any more progress).
He tried to cut the [c=leather 韦 ]leather [/c]with the [c= edge of a blade 刃]edge of a blade [/c]but it was too [k]tenacious[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]seems unable to make his own [p]running [/p]shoes.
There was a [c=trickle 巛 ]trickle [/c]of water directed on the [c= field 田]field[/c]. The plants needed for the modification of [k]steroid nucleus [/k]need a lot of water. The [p]giant [/p]made a pipe out of an old [p]xylophone[/p].
The [c=big 大 ]big [/c]boy [k]boasts [/k]a lot - even though he has a great [c=???]deficit [/c]of any skills. The [p]ghoslty giant[/p] guarding discipline admonishs him: &quot;[p]Kuá[/p], watch your vocabulary choice!&quot;
You are on a walk with [p]Ying[/p]. You meet a [p]dwarf[/p], who demonstrates a trick: In the [c= middle <span style="color:#ff0000;">央</span>]middle [/c]of a fountain you see the [c=sun <span style="color:#0000ff;">日</span> ]sun [/c]- it's [k]reflecting [/k]there. (how romantic)
(Under water.) She desperately tried to [c= reach　及]reach [/c]the air with her [c=mouth 口 ]mouth[/c], as she wanted to [k]breathe[/k]. But, fortunately, the [p]giant [/p]saw that and saved the [p]sheep[/p].
In the [c= {flood　<span style="color:#ff0000;">川</span>}]flood[/c], he goes around and loots [c=gold 金 ]gold[/c]. When he was picking up a [k]bracelet[/k], the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guarding the flooded [p]channel [/p]notices it and attacks him.
They have put some [c=grass ]grass [/c]in the [c= barn 仓]barn[/c]. As they came in next day, they found it turned [k]ash-gray[/k]! The [p]giant [/p]uses a [p]Stange [/p]to pick throught it to investigate.
You go past a [c= number of caves 孔]number of caves[/c], until you stop by a [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of a cave as you hear a [k]roar [/k]from inside. You ask the [p]Teddy [/p]inside: &quot;Is there a lion at your [p]home[/p]?&quot;
He was very hungry, but even after begging for [c=food ]food [/c]he started talking about various usages of [c= cloudy towel]cloudy towels [/c]as a [k]decoration[/k]. The [p]dwarfs [/p]throws a [p]shallot [/p]at him (hoping he will be finally quiet).<br /><br /><br />cloud + towel = cloudy towel
The [c=water 水 ]water [/c]flooded the house, even the [c= bookcase 且]bookcase [/c]was [k]destroyed[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]wanted to drink water instead of [p]juice [/p](and forgot to stop the tap!). Even worse that it's <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain </span>(and the windows are open).
The only thing containing [c=rice 米 ]rice [/c]the members of the Anti-Rice [c= sect 宗]sect [/c]ate - were [k]rice dumplings wrapped in leaves [/k](because you couldn't see the rice as it was hidden in the leaves). The [p]dwarf [/p]smuggled some from [p]Zongo[/p].<br /><img src="pastehhk8rt.jpg" />
&quot;What helps me ruling even such a [c=big 大 ]big county[/c], when I miss my ceremonial [c= county without stick 县]stick[/c]?&quot; ... It took a [k]number of collections [/k]to trade it with the [p]dwarf[/p], who has stolen it into his [p]tower[/p].
The [c=words 讠]words [/c]that were written on the [c= leather 韦]leather [/c](of the corpse) became [k]taboo[/k]. Only the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]repeats them during the long misty nights - when he is hidden in the [p]hay[/p].
He was quite [c=shaggy <span style="color:#ff0000;">髟 </span>]shaggy[/c], so he considered, if he should wear his hear in a [c= &quot;sphere&quot; (as a shape) 睘]sphere [/c]form, or make [k]a knot of hair on top of head[/k]. The [p]ghostly fairy[/p], guarding the hairstylist, gives him advice on the latest fashion of [p]Han[/p].
[c=father 父 ]Father [/c]has [c=  {many 多}]many [/c]jobs, but his favorite is being [k]dad[/k]. The [p]two [/p](brothers) [p]giants [/p]think of their dad, who is already [p]dead[/p].
&quot;Before both your [c=heart ]heart [/c]and [c= brain]brain [/c]is full of anger and you don't want [k]to get angry[/k], try taking some [p]NaOH[/p].&quot;, [p]Teddy [/p]suggests (he recently started to fancy chemistry.)
You mere writing a [c=booklet ]booklet [/c]on your PC (for quite a longtime...). But accidentally - you clicked [k]delete[/k]! You grabbed a [c=???]knife [/c]and wanted to destroy the f*king PC！The [p]giant [/p]offers you [p]shandy [/p]to calm you down.
If you will keep up [c= tap]tapping[/c] (in rhytm) at [c=work ]work[/c], you will soon be [k]attacked [/k]by mad workers. Only the [p]giant [/p]is allowed to tap the [p]gong[/p].
The wanted to [c= to present 呈]present [/c]a new cholocate mark. (As a part of the campaign) they ornated a long [c=road ]road [/c]with the chocolate - to really [k]show off[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]follows them, colllecting [p]chunks [/p]of chocolate.
When you see the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]no more, and even the [c= sound　音]sounds [/c]are gone, it is already [k]dark[/k]. In that case avoid the evil [p]dwarf [/p]with the [p]anchor [/p](roaming alone in the dark).
Look, there, in the [c=west 西 ]west [/c]- there is a [c= shelter 广 ]shelter[/c], [c= compare with 比]compared with [/c]the [k]deer[/k] standing next to it it's quite big. &quot;Don't [p]look[/p]&quot; the [p]dwarf[/p] says (aiming).
They imported some [c=cow 牛 ]cows [/c]from the [c= west 西]west [/c]- to be used for the [k]sacrifice[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]is happy that they spare his [p]sheep[/p].
&quot;The [c=hemp 麻　]hemp [/c]is an invention from [c= ghost 鬼]ghosts [/c]and [k]devils[/k]. Who will smoke hemp, will never become a nice [p]model[/p].&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]moralises.
He found the piece of [c=earth 土]earth [/c]reminds him that all is [c= void 虚]void [/c]- there were only [k]ruins [/k]left. The [p]giant [/p]tells him he should not go out in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, especially when he isn't wearing any [p]shoes[/p]!
[p]Two dwarfs[/p] sit on a [p]bench[/p]. The one is eating [c=rice 米 ]rice [/c]from his [c= berret]berret[/c]. The other one (envious as he is hungry too) comments: &quot;Can't you even [k]distinguish [/k]between a berret and a plate?&quot;
They [c= sell 卖]sell [/c]the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]anyway, they don't care that is has been [k]defiled[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]tries filtering through [p]duvets [/p](but it stinks even more).
The [c=house ]house [/c]was on [c= fire]fire[/c]! What a [k]disaster[/k]. The [p]giant[/p] sounds disaster alarm by a [p]xylophone[/p].
&quot;The long [c= drought 旱]drought [/c]that are common there can be dangerous for your [c=heart ]heart[/c].&quot; &quot;It's fine, I'm [k]dauntless[/k]!&quot;. The [p]dwarf[/p] says that all Han are [p]dauntless[/p].
Since [c= Wei dynasty 魏]Wei [/c]dynasty is a tower [k]towering [/k]on the [c=mountain 山 ]mountain[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]still remembers helping the [p]Wei [/p]build it.
The [c= cow 牛]cow [/c]is carrying a [c=cocoon ]cocon [/c]on her head. But then it falls down - and to cow [k]moos[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]laughts and [p]moos [/p]too.
His [c= visitor 宾]visitor [/c]loved to see [c=water 水 ]water[/c], so he took him to visit all the [k]shores[/k]. They are friendly greeted by the [p]giant [/p]emptying the recycle [p]bins [/p](on the shores).<br />率土之濱、莫非王臣。<br />率土之滨、莫非王臣。 <br />Shijing II. 6. (205)<br /><br />
In the time of [c= peace 安]peace[/c], a low quality [c=leather 革 ]leather [/c]could be used for the [k]saddles [/k](because they wouldn't get damaged in combat). But - the [p]giant [/p]cannot hang his [p]anchor [/p]there now.
Only a [c=slice <span style="color:#0000ff;">片</span> ]slice [/c]of cheese was delivered to the [p]fairy[/p]. And even the slice was of [c= inferior <span style="color:#ff0000;">卑</span>]inferior [/c]quality. She puts up a [k]signboard[/k]: &quot;YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE A FREE [p]PIE[/p] FRIGID CHEESE DEALERS!&quot;
You have to [c=cough slightly 殸 ]cough slightly [/c]as the [c= fragrant 香]fragrant [/c]parfume is [k]smelling [/k]a little too much. The [p]giant [/p]experimented by making a parfume from a [p]shin [/p]bone.
As he opens [c=mouth ]mouth[/c], you can hear a sound of his [c= stomach 胃]stomach[/c]. He [k]sighs [/k]only. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]seems to have done something nasty to the [p]kid[/p].
Now, if we [c= to ladle out 舀]ladle out [/c]the [c=water ]water[/c], it might keep bubling for a while, since we take it straight from the [k]torrent-dash[/k]. Please proceed for the next experiments by the [p]giant [/p]in the [p]tower[/p].
A [k]slave girl [/k]is a [c=woman <span style="color:#00aa00;">女</span> ]woman[/c], that is quite [c= inferior <span style="color:#ff0000;">卑</span>]inferior [/c]in the family rank. The [p]dwarf [/p]feeds her with [p]beans [/p]only. (uhmp)
&quot;Why do you have [c=fire 火 ]fire [/c]in your mouth?&quot; &quot;[c=　because 因]Because [/c]I smoke [k]tobacco[/k]. &quot;The [p]giant [/p]has [p]yan[/p] to have some too (but he gets none).
He could even find out how [c= old 古]old [/c]the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]is by simply tasting it. jack of all [k]trades[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]brings in a [p]goose[/p], to see if he can speak with animals, too.
Why do you like this particular [c=clothing ]clothing[/c]? [c= because]Because[/c]... the [k]sleeves [/k]feel so gut. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]discuss if it would not be better to have sleeveless garments for the [p]show[/p].
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]has a [c= rule 则]rule [/c]- &quot;Rule of [k]side[/k]-steaks&quot;: He always starts eating [p]steaks[/p] from side (he learned that from a [p]dwarf[/p] - who had to split them to dwarf portions).
The [c=king 王 ]king [/c]hunts the [c= ghost 鬼]ghost[/c], to get at least a [k]semi-precious stone[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]wants to help him and strikes him with a [p]guitar[/p].
Outside your house was a [c=flood 川 ]flood[/c], and you could see see it [k]trickles [/k]inside - soon there will be a [c= flood 川]flood [/c]inside your house too. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]guarding the [p]channels [/p]tries his best to stop the floods, but he's not yet successful.
He makes a [c=step forward 彳]step forward [/c]towards the [c= temple 寺]temple[/c]. The [p]dwarf [/p]is [k]treating [/k]the people coming to [p]dye[/p] the paraments.<br /><br />neplést: 得<br />诗
The [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]they had to [c= supervise 监]supervise [/c]was cut out and turned into a door's [k]threshold[/k].  The [p]two dwarfs [/p]were lost in [p]gentlemen [/p]small talk and didn't pay attention.
Even thought he became the head of the [c=feudal state 薛 ]feudal state[/c], he still had complexes being taunted as a [c= child]child[/c] because of being a [k]son born of a concubine[/k]. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]carry in a [p]net [/p]to catch all those, who taunted him in that days.
Give a [c=hand ]hand[/c], it's almost [c= night 夜]night [/c]and the bedclothes have not yet been [k]tucked[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]helps, even thought he thinks the [p]yetti[/p] would not mind that (he is used to sleep in all conditions).
They achieved [k]victory[/k] in the battle because of their [c= agile 疌]agile[/c] [c=???]hands[/c]. The[p] two fairies [/p]will promptly bring a [p]jelly[/p] cake to celebrate the triumph (which they eat with their agile hands).
He has to [k]toss [/k]the basketball ball - he has to gather [c= power 力]power [/c]by swinging around [c= nine (basketball) 九 ]nine [/c]times and then wave his [c=hand 手 ]hand[/c]. The [p]giant[/p] tries to crash to ball to [p]powder[/p].
Everybody stretched their [c=hand 手 ]hand[/c], and recieved a [c= blade of grass 乇]blade of grass[/c]. This is the symbol for that they are the new [k]trustees [/k]of the agricultural bank. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]will live in the [p]tower [/p](of the bank building - and guard the bank).
The [c=uncle 叔 ]uncle [/c](father's younger brother) wanted somethng to show he is the one that can [k]supervise and direct[/k]. He directs the [p]giant [/p]the provide him with [p]duvets [/p]that each has an [c= eye 目]eye [/c]on it (and supervises him nailing them)..
As he [c= to come across 逢]came across [/c]the [c=bamboo ⺮ ]bamboo[/c], he was happy: &quot;Now I only need a [k]sail [/k]and a build the boat!&quot; The [p]fairy [/p]helps him search to make sure he will be [p]punctually [/p]at home.
&quot;Why are you [k]twisting [/k]my [c=hand ]hand [/c]so [c=???]shamefully[/c]?!&quot; one [p]Teddy[/p] says to the other. You're such a [p]notorious[/p] twister!
The [c=dog 犬　]dog [/c]was [c= especially 尤]especially [/c]evil, [k]just as [/k]he was reputed. The [p]fairy [/p]asks: &quot;[p]Yokels[/p], could you tame him?&quot;
He [c=enjoy 享]enjoyed [/c]playing around the [c=city⻏]city[/c]. What he loved most was to climb the [k]outer city wall[/k]. He is wise enough to notify the [p]ghostly giant[/p] everytime he wants to [p]go[/p] up (he will guard him and keep him safe).
She entertained the [c= visitor 宾]visitors[/c] at the same time working with [c=thread 糸 ]thread[/c], which made quite a [k]helter-skelter[/k] impression. The [p]giant [/p]would help her, but now he went empty the recycle [p]bin [/p](obviously he doesn't like entertaining visitors so much).
&quot;A [c=horse 马 ]horse [/c]can [k]run fast[/k], who can run fast [c= also 也]also[/c]?&quot; the teacher asks. The [p]fairy [/p]offers [p]chapati [/p]to the first kid wins the race (but it is not really motivating them...).
The scouts have to pass a last test (before they are allowed [k]to scout = explore[/k] the unknown terrain): they have to put their [c=hand ]hand[/c] inside a [c= hearth 罙]hearth[/c]. The [p]dwarf[/p] calls out the names of the qualified scouts by the [p]tannoy[/p].
They were [c= occupied 占]occupied [/c]producing [k]glutinous [/k]stuff from [c=rice 米 ]rice[/c]. The [p]two fairies [/p]bring in more rice on a [p]nanny [/p]goat (but the nanny gets her feet glued and can't walk anymore!)<br><br>also pronounced <span style="color:#ff0000;">zhān</span>
The fox spirits want to eat well nurtured [c= heart 心]hearts [/c]from this [c=((reverse) nurture) county 育 ]county[/c]. So the [k]hang [/k]their victims upside down, and work on their hearts. The [p]ghostly fairy [/p]keeps notes (of how long their hearts have been nurtured, in her [p]šanon[/p]).
&quot;What is this strange [c=illness 疒 ]illnes [/c]spread by?&quot; &quot;I was hit by some kind of [c= arrow 矢]arrow [/c]and then I got this [k]sickness[/k]. &quot; The [p]fairy [/p]guides the [p]jeep [/p](to investigate in the town).
He had a strange [c=illness 疒 ]illnes[/c], that cause his [c= whole 全]whole [/c]body to ache. Fortunately, he found a way [k]to recover (from illness)[/k]. He visited the [p]ghostly fairy [/p]- guarding the medicine on an island - and had her [p]chant [/p]a chant to him (and that cured him).
He wanted to create a triangle from a pair of [c= horns]horns[/c]. &quot;But, you need [c=three (triangle) ]three [/c]sides for a triangle!&quot; &quot;Ok, so let's take an [k]orchid[/k] to it. Hopefully it won't be turned blue by the [p]fairy[/p]'s [p]lantern[/p].&quot;
You enter through the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the [c= dragon 龙]dragon [/c](big as a mouth of a cave) and walk down his [k]gullet[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]warned you this is a [p]long[/p] journey.
The [c=earth 土 ]earth [/c]was still there at [c= dawn 旦]dawn [/c](even thought they were supposed to move it away overnight). But the boss is [k]open-hearted[/k] (and doesn't get angry). He even let [p]Teddy [/p]play with the [p]tannoy [/p](making the workers not so happy).
You have to [c=pay out 交 ]pay out [/c]the price, then [c= tap]tap [/c]the red button, and you will achieve the desired [k]effect [/k]- the [p]two dwarfs [/p]will never ever take a [p]shower [/p]anymore.
<br />(Justice is done at the [k]palace hall[/k]:) They hold the criminal[c=corpse 尸　] [/c]that is about to be [c= collectivelly 公　]collectivelly [/c]striked (and becomes a [c=???]corpse [/c]afterwards). The [p]two dwarfs [/p](court servants) say: you shouldn't have killed the [p]dentist[/p], you shouldn't...
If you are [c= smallest 幺 ]smallest [/c]among the smaller than the [c= smallest 幺]smallest[/c], perhaps it would be better for you to be [k]hidden away [/k]inside a [c=mountain 山 ]mountain[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]consoles you: &quot;I was small too, when I was [p]young[/p].&quot;
Since he doesn't see well under [c=moon 月 ]moon[/c]light, his enemy [c= manage 办]managed [/c]to [k]threaten [/k]him from a side. Fortunately, he was helped by the [p]two fairies [/p]- who signalized him from their [p]shack[/p].
It was very [k]impetuous [/k]from the [c= pigeon 隹]pigeon[/c] to fly in the [c=rain 雨 ]rain[/c]. Fortunately, after an argument, the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]let's him hide in the [p]hole [/p]he is guarding (until the rain is over).
The [c=net 罒 ]net [/c]was completely [c= un- 非]un[/c]-usable. &quot;Who has the [k]guilt[/k]?&quot; The [p]ghoslty dwarf [/p](that was actually supposed to guard it) is angry (but it is also his guilt, because a few minutes before, you could hear [p]z..z...z..[/p] from him).
At [c=work 工 ]work[/c], they worked at improving the [c= power 力]power [/c]plant. Every [k]achievement [/k]was announced by the [p]giant [/p]by ringing a [p]gong[/p].<br>武功 - martial art
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]<span style="font-style:italic;">admonishes </span>the guests to [c= to respect 敬]respect [/c]the coming guest. &quot;I [k]warn [/k]you, he is an influental person.&quot; But [p]Teddy [/p]ignores him, and only plays [p]jingling [/p]bells.
Trees can have [k]such-and-such [/k]fruits (sweet or not). Hmm, the this [c= tree 木]tree [/c]has fruits that are [c=sweet / willing 甘 ]sweet [/c](and the tree is certainly willing to get rid of them). It's like somebody has added <span style="font-style:italic;">sugar </span>from <span style="font-style:italic;">above of the tree</span>. [p]Teddy [/p]decorates the fruits with his [p]mousse[/p] (to make them even sweeter).<br />vs: 柑 large tangerine
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]gets his path blocked by a big rock. &quot;You act [c= &quot;as / if&quot; 若]as if [/c]you didn't expect it. &quot; &quot;Yes, but not [k]to such a degree[/k]. &quot; But in the end, they manage to convince the [p]ghostly dwarf[/p] guarding the [p]rock [/p]to help them.
<br />The [p]dwarf[/p][c=sun ],[/c] owner of the [p]hotel[/p], got pretty dick[k] (thick)[/k]. &quot;Y'know, the tourists in the area around this [c= cliff]cliff[/c] are known for their [c= kid (generosity (of the nature)) ]generosity[/c], it's easy to get thick.&quot;
You have to practice until you will be able to measure exactly [k]30 catties [/k]of [c=gold ]gold [/c]in an [c= even 匀]even[/c] smoothed cube. This is exactly how much gold the [p]žuna [/p]will take to the [p]giant[/p].<br /><br /><br />vs: to practice 习
&quot;We have got a [c= few 少]few [/c]from the [c=water 水 ]water[/c].&quot; &quot;A few of what?&quot; &quot;A few [k]granules[/k]. That's what the [p]giant [/p]wanted, the one that said [p]shalom [/p]to us.&quot;
&quot;Give me a [c=hand 手　]hand [/c]with [c= that 那]that[/c]!&quot; (They both steer at once). The car [k]veers [/k]suddenly, the passangers fly a little forward. &quot;I would break my ghostly [p]nose [/p]if I weren't ghostly!&quot; the [p]ghostly fairy [/p]complains (guarding the backseat).
[c=if 如 ]If [/c]you could really [k]forgive [/k]me inside your [c= heart 心]heart[/c]... The [p]dwarf [/p]takes off his [p]shoes [/p]as he kneels down.
There is [c=water 水 ]water [/c]on the ground, on the edge [c= stand 立]stands [/c]a child and [k]sobs[/k] (the water is a small lake of his tears). The [p]dwarf [/p]has eaten my [p]cheese[/p]!
You got a [c= bundel]bundel[/c], with various kinds of food inside. You taste one, and it's very [k]hot (spicy)[/k]! But you don't like [c=spicy ]spicy [/c]food... The [p]dwarf [/p]probably added some [p]lava[/p] there (to make it taste REALLY hot)!
She see a [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]eating her [c= melon 瓜]melon [/c]outside. As she approaches him, she notices it's a [k]fox [/k](not a dog). &quot;[p]Who [/p]let you in here?&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]asks.
She [c= right hand 又]shakes hand [/c]with the [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]- she became the [k]authority [/k]over it. The [p]fairy [/p]will now guard it, she has to [p]chant [/p]to it.
The [c=heart ]heart [/c]of the oldest daugther of the [c= Min]Min [/c]family is full of [k]pity[/k]. The [p]Teddy[/p], that used to stand before their doors, have left the [p]Min[/p] family.
(<span style="font-style:italic;">hluboce dýchat</span>)<br />(At the mouth of a cave.) He was really [c= concentrated 耑]concentrated[/c]. And then - a splash! sound. First he covers his [c=mouth ]mouth [/c](terrified), but only [k]pants[/k] then. The [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]jumped into the [p]channel [/p]he was guarding to frighted him, but he materialized on the bank again.
The [c=criminal ]criminal[/c] wants to escape, but he hits a new [c= mountain]mountain[/c] in his way! He [k]hits[/k] it angrily. (The [p]giant[/p] moved it there overnight with his [p]jeep[/p], to prevent his escape.)
The [c=water ]water [/c]on him [c= dry]dried [/c]very quickly, causing the [k]perspiration [/k]to be felt around him soon. The [p]dwarf [/p]doesn't mind that as he feels as a [p]Han[/p].
Now, you have to feel [k]pity [/k]in your [c=heart ]heart[/c]. I [c=???]COMMAND [/c]YOU! The [p]two fairies [/p]play a tragedy with two bowls of [p]lentil[/p].
As you walk the [c=winding 宛 ]winding [/c]road down, a [c= knife 刂]knife [/c]flies your way as somebody tries to [k]gouge out [/k]your eyes. Fortunately, he gets hit by the [p]giant[/p] that lost control of his [p]van[/p].
The [c= fortune teller ]fortune teller [/c](in service) topples a [c= dish]dish[/c] to [c=earth ]earth[/c]. She foretells: &quot;Because it contained so much [k]salt[/k], it seems, the [p]fairy[/p] has [p]yen[/p] to make you more salty.&quot;
&quot;[c=rice <span style="color:#00aa00;">米</span> ]Rice [/c]with [c= lamb <span style="color:#ff0000;">羔</span>]lamb [/c]- what could be better?&quot; &quot;A [k]cake[/k]!&quot; Unfortunately, the [p]giant [/p]couldn't join the meal as he has [p]gout[/p].
The [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]always envied not being the king of the jungle, but once he armed himself with a [c= knife 刀 ]knife[/c], and put a [c= sash (冖 on top of 巾)]sash [/c]over him - and went to challenge the [k]lion[/k]. But as he came, the lion was just being fed by the [p]giant [/p]- eating [p]shallots[/p].<br />
How can we eat from [k]plates [/k]on a [c=boat 舟 ]boat[/c]? We can take big [c=???]dishes[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]says: &quot;Or we can eat the meat we roasted on [p]pans [/p]with bare hands!&quot;
As he found out that his [c=slave 奴 ]slave [/c]has stolen his (replacement) [c= heart 心]heart [/c](and escaped), he started blazing with [k]fury[/k]. (But it won't make things better.) The [p]dwarf[/p]'s only chance to live is now to eat a lot of [p]noodles[/p].
The [c= minister 郎]minister [/c]was taking a very good care of the [c=countryside 乡 ]countryside[/c]. You can see that this was his [k]home village[/k].<br />The [p]two giants [/p]from [p]Shanghai [/p]are very impressed.<br /><span style="font-style:italic;">(this traditional character is also a part of other simplified characters, so it's listed here for mnemonics)</span>
There was an [c=insect 虫 ]insect [/c]trained to assassinate the [c= emperor 皇]emperor[/c]. It was a [k]locust[/k], and it was waiting in the [p]hangar [/p]guarded by the [p]ghostly fairy[/p].
He had to lie on the [c= earth 土]earth[/c] as a [c=punishment 刑 ]punishment[/c], until the [k]model [/k]was finished. The [p]fairy [/p]is building one of [p]shingles[/p].
&quot;How is it possible you [c= scorched 焦]scorched [/c]the entire area with just a single [c=whiskey bottle 酉 ]whiskey bottle[/c]?&quot; &quot;Well, originally I intended to [k]perform sacrifice [/k](to a wood god - so the entire forest started burning). The [p]two dwarfs [/p]are shocked as they return from the [p]jousting [/p]match.
I ... just ... cannot ... breathe the [c=air 气 ]air[/c]. Why? [c= because 因]Because[/c].... because.... don't know... may there is a .... [k]magic emanation[/k]. Please ask the [p]giant [/p]... to check the [p]yin [/p]balance.
(RPG - a thieves conference) We have some [c=gold ]gold[/c], but what we need is some [k]acute [/k](sharp) knives! Perhaps we can have [c= convert (兑)]convert [/c]that by a trader in the city. The [p]ghostly dwarf[/p], a city guard, says: [p]Relinquish[/p] your stupid ideas a relinquish the city at once!
The [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]has a [c= &quot;vacation-part&quot; 叚]part of the vacation [/c]every day: in the night it has [k]leisure-time[/k]. The sun likes to drive [p]sharks [/p]with the [p]two fairies [/p]every night.
In the process of [c= division 分]division [/c]of this kind of [c=grass 草 ]grass[/c], an inspiration for a new [k]perfume [/k]was found. The [p]giant [/p]thinks it is [p]fun [/p]to make such inventions during hard work.
The only way to [c=dispel 辟 ]dispel [/c]the [k]jade annulus [/k]it to replace it's [c= jade 玉]jade[/c]. Send the [p]Teddy [/p]to trade some for a sack of [p]beans[/p]!
He goes to the [c=door 尸 ]door [/c]and returns. [c= to go and return 復]Goes and returns[/c]. He is trying to find a new way to dry his [k]footwear[/k].<br>[p]Teddy [/p]tries to do it in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, until he finds out that it is quite [p]lurdiculous[/p].
The written [c=words 讠 ]words [/c]were looking [c= desolate 荒]desolate[/c], made even worse by the fact that it were only [k]lies[/k]. The [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]feels pity for it and stores them in the [p]hangar [/p]he is guarding.
The [c=grain 禾 ]grain [/c]is already some [c= years old 岁]years old[/c], the sacks have caught some [k]dirt[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]supposed to guard it tries to use a [p]hifi [/p]to clear it (with ultrasound).
He was throwing some [c=grain 禾 ]grain [/c]to the [c= pigeon 隹]pigeons[/c]. He loved it, even though some considered it [k]infantile[/k]. The [p]dwarf[/p], for example, prefers to spend his evenings in the [p]jacuzzi[/p].
There was [c= none]none [/c]who had [c=water ]water [/c]in the [k]desert[/k]. The only thing the [p]dwarf [/p]could do is to [p]model [/p]a sand statue (of a well).
She says: &quot;I find your <span style="font-style:italic;">black </span>[c=eye 目 ]eyes [/c]completely [k]dazzling[/k]. They look so [c= black/mysterious 玄]mysterious[/c]...&quot; But the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]ignores her, and continues to guard his [p]šanons [/p](she was trying to dazzle him to get the šanons herself).
The judge shows the [c=half 半 ]half [/c]of a [c= knife]knife[/c]: &quot;I [k]judge[/k], the [p]dwarf [/p]did not use a [p]pan [/p]to kill the victim. &quot;
The [c=sun <span style="color:#0000ff;">日</span> ]sun [/c]is shining so strong over the [c= military <span style="color:#ff0000;">军</span>]military[/c] camp. Several soldiers [k]fainted [/k]already. The [p]giant [/p]takes them to the [p]Union[/p] (of Hospitals).<br /><br />nb: pronounciation similiar to <span style="color:#ff0000;">军 </span>(but y instead of j)
(After a party.)  They wake up with (empty) [c=whisky bottle 酉 ]whisky bottles[/c], feeling [k]intoxicated[/k]. Oh, yesterday they were all so [c=  sweet / willing 甘]sweet [/c]and willing... The [p]giant [/p]came to the aftermath of the [p]Han [/p]party (not capable of understanding what happened).
He had put some [c= feather 羽]feathers [/c]around a [c=branch 支 ]branch [/c]- creating an improvised [k]wing[/k]. (Unfortunately, he crashes.) The [p]dwarf [/p]confuses him (his smashed body) with [p]chapati [/p](and eats it (yup!)).
What's that [c=black <span style="color:#ff0000;">黑</span> ]black [/c]puddle on in the [c= earth <span style="color:#00aa00;">土</span>]earth[/c]? &quot;Don't care, guess it's just [k]ink[/k]&quot; - says the [p]dwarf[/p], continuing tatooing characters to his [p]model[/p] of an earth castle.
The [c=road ]road [/c]marked [c= white 白]white [/c]was longer than the other one, however he [k]forced [/k]us to go the white one. It was because the [p]dwarf [/p]hates [p]porcupines [/p](that we would meet there).
There was a [c=hand 手 ]hand [/c]statue pointing to the [c= exit 出]exit[/c]. But nobody liked it as it looked very [k]inelegant[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p](guarding the exit) thinks too that it is a bad [p]joke[/p].
If you can't even tell if the food is made of [c=fish 鱼 ]fish [/c]or [c= sheep 羊]sheep[/c], it is certainly not [k]fresh[/k]. The [p]two giants [/p](responsible for the storage) probably made a mistake in their [p]šanons[/p].
[c=foot ⻊ ]Foot [/c]always moving, he wasted a [c= long life 寿]long life [/c]only by [k]waver[/k]ing. The [p]fairy [/p]only [p]chokes[/p] seeing how he wavered all the time.
The [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]had to [c= act as 当]act as [/c]a carrier of the ancient [k]records[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]hangs out purses with messages on it and they [p]dangle [/p]in the wind.
The [c= name 名]name [/c]was written in [c=gold 金 ]gold[/c]. And under it was an [k]inscribed motto[/k]: &quot;Helped the [p]fairy [/p]recover her [p]mink [/p]coat.&quot;
Her [c=heart ]heart [/c]is beating [c= energetic <span style="color:#ff0000;">贲 </span>]energetically [/c]- she's very [k]indignant[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]replies: &quot;Com'on, it was only [p]fun[/p]. &quot;
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]will not [c= work 干]work [/c]with you, if they think you are a [k]traitor[/k]. But the [p]two giants [/p]are good [p]gentlemen [/p](so she will work with them).
He was too [c= tired <span style="color:#ffaa00;">乏</span>]tired [/c]to do anything else but to [k]float [/k]on the [c=water ]water[/c]. His [p]dwarf [/p]servant had to wave a [p]fan[/p] for him.
The farmers try to [c=cover ]cover [/c]all their [c= rabbit]rabbits [/c](to avoid having to pay taxes) - but they get discovered. &quot;Taxes are [k]injustice[/k]!&quot; they yell hopelessly. The [p]giant [/p]gives them some [p]yuan [/p]coins (to pay the taxes and fine with).
He was [c=cagey 昚 ]cagey[/c]: he took only a [c= small 小]small [/c]thing and put a lot of [k]fuel used for sacrifices[/k] (so that it will certainly burn completely). The [p]two dwarfs [/p]are angry as the burning fire is making [p]loud[/p] sounds.
He could hear a [c=foot ⻊ ]foot [/c]stepping [c= heavy 重]heavily [/c]somewhere behind him. Did somebody [k]follow [/k]him? Actually, it is just [p]Teddy[/p], trying to find out where he hid the [p]jonquils[/p].
(He spitted on a seashell - and it got angry and broke. ) &quot;You'll have to [k]indemnify[/k] me for the loss of my [c=<span style="font-size:small;">seashell ]seashell[/c]. You can't just [c=???]spit [/c]on it - you should have known it would break!&quot; The [p]fairy[/p]:&quot;Yes, you'll have to [p]pay[/p]!&quot;
He wanted to get the [c=dog 犬 ]dog[/c]'s [c= bone 骨]bone [/c]- and he was [k]crafty [/k](he offered the dog meat - and he opened his mouth - and the bone dropped). The [p]fairy [/p](supposed to guard the dog) has a [p]hard [/p]time not to laugh.
You read the [c=words 讠]words [/c]on the contract given to you: and [c= suddenly 乍]suddenly[/c], you an idea pops on your mind: they are trying to [k]swindle[/k] you! That would explain, why the [p]dwarf [/p]suddenly switched to such a complicated [p]jargon[/p].
He wanted to play a prank on her, so he wanted to plant [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]before her [c= door 户]door[/c]. And it turned out what he planted was [k]reed [/k](so he water it heavely also, making a lake there, that won't make her very happy...) Even the [p]fairy [/p]thinks it is [p]lurdiculous[/p].
He opens his [c=mouth ]mouth [/c](as to say something) - but it's [c= void <span style="color:#ff0000;">虚</span>]void[/c]: he doesn't say anything. In the end he only [k]hisses[/k]: &quot;The [p]giant [/p]stole the [p]shoes [/p](being covered by <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>)!&quot;
He tried waving his [c=hand ⺘]hand[/c] to [k]ward off [/k]the impending [c=???]droughts[/c]. The [p]dwarf [/p]only laughts how superstitious this [p]Han [/p]is.
The [c= unicorn 一]unicorn [/c]tried to bring the [c=axe 斤 ]axe [/c]from the [k]hillock[/k], bot he could pick it up. He had to ask the [p]two giants [/p]to help him - in return they'll get some [p]chokers[/p].
&quot;What a strange [c=thread ]thread[/c]? It is <span style="font-style:italic;">winded </span>around a [c= Chieftain Yao 尧]Chieftain Yao [/c]statue? Why would somebody make a [k]coil [/k]out of a statue?&quot; But it is because the [p]dwarf [/p]wanted to smuggle the statue into [p]Rao[/p].
With [c=two hands 廾　]two hands[/c], he holds [c= hairs 彡]hairs [/c](and puts them around the statue)- he tries to copy it's [k]shape[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]offers him some [p]shilling [/p]instead.
The [c=a bird flying high ambition 隺 ]bird [/c]flew down and then up again - the [k]crane [/k]was [c=???]a bird flying with high ambition[/c]. He hopes to be made immortal by stealing the [p]herbs [/p]from the [p]dwarf[/p].
You notice a half-hidden path on a [c=mound ]mound [/c]- when you try to follow it, the [c= {(ancient) monkey 禺}](ancient) monkey [/c]jums out: &quot;This is my [k]corner[/k], please keep out!&quot; But the [p]fairy [/p]tricks it away by playing [p]ukulele[/p], so you can take a look in (it's <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, so the monkey can't see you well).
Under the [c=moon 月 ]moonlight[/c], he picked up what he first thought was a [c= branch 支]branch[/c]. Now what for a [k]limb [/k]is this? It turned out, the [p]giant[/p]'s [p]jacuzzi [/p]went wrong (and did cut him in pieces).
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]has respect to everybody, but [c= especially 尤]especially [/c]to people that are [k]superior [/k]to him. But the [p]giant [/p]treats even the [p]yokels [/p]as superior to him.
You could see [k]sprout [/k]among the [c=grass 草 ]grass [/c]on the [c=???]fields[/c]. The [p]two fairies [/p]started flying around, pursuing the [p]mouses [/p](that were trying to eat the sprouts).
The [c=water ]water [/c]has become [c= superfluous 冗]superfluous [/c]in that area. The [p]fairy [/p]uses it to [k]submerge [/k]her superfluous [p]česneks[/p].
After you come to your [c=house ]house[/c], you find it has been occupied by [c= soldiers 兵]soldiers[/c]. &quot;I see we have [k]visitors[/k]...&quot; But the [p]giant [/p]have already invited them to what's in your recycle [p]bin[/p].
He had a [c= trouble 娄]trouble [/c]with the [c=clothing ]clothing [/c]- he found out it was [k]tattered[/k]. That's why [p]Teddy [/p]ran into the <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain </span>to get a new one - unfortunately he brought a rather [p]lurdiculous[/p] one.
Normally, you can see the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]well, but now it is covered by [c= mist 蒙]mist[/c]. So it's [k]indistinct[/k]. You can see it only when a <span style="font-style:italic;">lightning</span> strikes. (The mist covering the world because the [p]fairy [/p]is looking for the swine with the unicorn to take them to [p]Mengele[/p]).
[c= use 以]Use [/c]some [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]nad mix it with the [k]common plantain[/k], so we can get chewing gums for it. The [p]Teddy [/p]notes the results of the kids to an [p]easel[/p].<br><br /><br>(asoc: collecting plantain as a kid (but I didn't cheat :) )
(colt as a young horse)<br />They tried teaching [c=horse 马 ]horses [/c]human language and they even managed to teach one [c= sentence 句]sentence[/c] to the [k]colt[/k]! &quot;I want to learn [p]judo [/p]with the [p]giant[/p]!&quot;
He put the [c= calyx 疐]calyx [/c]near his [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]- but he had to [k]sneeze[/k] instantly. The [p]dwarf [/p]examines the contents of the calyx with a [p]teaspoon[/p].
The [c=water ]water [/c]seems especially <span style="font-style:italic;">moist</span> today, so [k]smooth[/k], could it be that it's because it's an [c= intercalary <span style="color:#0000ff;">闰</span>]intercalary [/c]year now? &quot;No, it's because [p]Rooney [/p]paid the [p]dwarf [/p]to apply some softerens to it.&quot;
(A warning sign.) If you will [k]urinate [/k]here, you will end up as a [c=corpse 尸 ]corpse [/c]under [c= water 水]water[/c]! It's because the [p]two dwarfs[/p] hat set up a trap with [p]NaOH [/p]there (tired of people wanting to urinate there).
He's trying to [c=acquire <span style="color:#00aa00;">取</span> ]acquire [/c]new skills, so he [k]congregates [/k]all (martial arts) experts - to [c= stand side by side <span style="color:#0000ff;">乑</span>]stand side by side [/c]to him (and teach him). The [p]dwarf [/p]wants to become a [p]judo [/p]master at any costs.
The [c= sect 宗]sect[/c], that took it's place at the highest [c=mountaion 山 ]mountain[/c], was very [k]sublime[/k]. They could even send the [p]fairy [/p]to [p]Chong [/p]the philosopher.
You can see the [c= twins 双]twins [/c]moving the mouth to each other's [c=ear 耳 ]ear[/c], and hear some [k]whispering[/k]. [p]Two dwarf [/p]assistans run to them and command them to [p]knee [/p](because they are not allowed to speak now).
&quot;[k]Hey! [/k]What are you [c= black 黑]black [/c]one doing at my [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave?&quot; &quot;Hey! Hey! Hey! I'm selling [p]hay [/p]made by the [p]giant[/p].&quot;
Come [c= inform 告]inform [/c]me after you manage to paint the [c=white 白 ]white [/c]to be really [k]snow-white[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]has no tolerance about the painting of his [p]house[/p].
The [c=air 气 ]air [/c]did reflect the mood every time they came to [c= to feed a prisoner 昷]feed the prisoner [/c]- there was a [k]heavy atmosphere[/k]. To resolve it, the [p]giant [/p]helps him contacting the Prisoner's [p]Union[/p]
&quot;Isn't [c= cruel 暴]water cruel[/c]?&quot; &quot;Com'on, it's just a [k]waterfall[/k].&quot;[c=water ] [/c]The [p]dwarf [/p]jumps in it - he wants to see the [p]pool [/p]that's supposedly hidden behind it.<br><br><span style="color:#0000ff;">bào </span>= shower (rain) (<span style="font-style:italic;">přeháňka</span>)
After getting [c= old 古]old[/c], even though he was still quite [c=shaggy 髟 ]shaggy[/c], he considers stopping wearing a [k]topknot[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]driving him in a [p]jeep [/p]thinks that hairstyles don't matter.
The [c=cloud ]clouds [/c]on the [c= mountain 山]mountain [/c]confused the [c= unicorn 一 ]unicorn [/c]- and he accidentally runs into a stash of [k]pottery[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]consoles him it was [p]fouled[/p] anyway.
It was his [c= duty 责]duty [/c]to [k]soak [/k]all the [c=water ⺡]water [/c]when it came out. The suspected it was caused by a malicious [p]dwarf [/p]with a [p]zircon [/p]pot.
Even the [c= ordinary 凡]ordinary [/c]workers at [c=work 工 ]work [/c]had a strengthened, [k]solid [/k]discipline: they always resumed work when [p]Teddy [/p]rung the [p]gong[/p].
[p]Teddy [/p][k]sweeps [/k]the [c= snout 彐]snout[/c] with his [c=hand ]hand[/c], says: &quot;[p]Salo [/p]prefers to have no dust, not even on animals.&quot;
The [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]grew around the [c= tangled hemp 缊]tangled hemp[/c]. Soon, everybody wondered, why did the grass [k]accumulate [/k]on one spot. The [p]dwarf [/p]even hires the Gardeners [p]Union [/p]the examine the phenomenon.
Now [c= what 何]what [/c]is that for a [c=grass 艹 ]grass[/c]? What!? It's not a grass, it's [k]lotos[/k]! Ask the [p]fairy [/p]to give you a few lessons about [p]herbs[/p], your knowledge is terrible.
The [c= turtle 龟]turtle [/c]comes to the [c=gate 门 ]gate[/c], knocks, and asks if turtles also are allowed to draw [k]lots [/k](in this casino). The [p]two giants [/p]first make a few bad [p]jokes [/p]about turtles - and then let the turtle in.
[c=go 去 ]Go[/c]! Go in the city and use all the (man)[c= power 力]power[/c] to [k]plunder[/k] it completely! The [p]two fairies [/p]fly away from the city with a [p]jelly [/p]cake (at least something will be saved!)
He [c= to shame 忝]shamed [/c]his family that was responsible for the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]supplies - so he had to hurry to [k]replenish [/k]the resources. The [p]two giants [/p]playing [p]tennis [/p]got dursty (and they drink quite an amount of water...)
A lot of them got bitten by a [c= snake 巳]snake[/c], because they decided to go [c=collectively 共 ]collectively [/c]through a single [k]alley[/k]. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]argue that such things should not happen in [p]Shanghai[/p].
The [c= boy 儿]boy [/c]goes throught many (trash) [c=container 匚 ]containers[/c]: &quot;I found a [k]number of horses[/k] already!&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]tries feeding them with [p]pea[/p].
There has been some [c= words 讠]words [/c]written: &quot;Whoever dares to cut the [c=net 网 ]net [/c](with a [c= knife 刂]knife[/c]), will be [k]penalized[/k] (<span style="font-style:italic;">punished</span>)!&quot; The [p]fairy [/p]wants no sabbotages on her [p]farm[/p].
The [c=king 王 ]king [/c]wanted to ornate his [c= capital 京]capital[/c]: and he did it with [k]jasper[/k]. <br>The [p]two fairies[/p], living according to the philosophy of Chong ([p]Qiong[/p]), think it is a waste.<br><img src="paste9l6elk.jpg" />
[c=Harry ]Harry placed [/c]his sword [c= to place in between 夹]in between [/c]his dagger and his bottle. he decided to start a life like a [k]knight-errant[/k], hoping to become a <span style="font-style:italic;">hero</span>. The [p]two fairies [/p]follow him on his first quest: To defeat the evil [p]shark[/p].
He found an [c= easy 易]easy [/c]way to turn [c=gold 今 ]gold [/c]into [k]tin[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]said he would give him even his [p]sheep [/p]for a methode that can do the opposite .<br><br /><br>锡安 - Sion
The bird scratches the [k]pitcher [/k]with its [c=claw 爪 ]claw[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]shocked: &quot;[p]Yaow[/p]! It was no cheap [c= pot 䍃]pot[/c]!&quot;
The [c= jade block　圭]jade block [/c]hanging in the middle of the [c=door 门 ]door [/c]was marking the entrance to the [k]lady's chamber[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]guarding the lady's chamber is bored, so he practices playing a (ghostly) [p]guitar[/p].
Even thought the hall was [c= occupied 占]occupied[/c], he started spilling out [c=water 水 ]water [/c]on the floor. &quot;I want to [k]moisten [/k]the floor, because princess [p]Janit [/p]doesn't like walking on dry ground.&quot; the [p]giant [/p]says.
They worked [c= collectively 共]collectively [/c]on harvesting the [c=rice 米 ]rice[/c], but afterwards he had to fertilize the land with [k]manure [/k]alone (nobody liked the smell...). The [p]dwarf [/p]murmles as he finds it no [p]fun[/p].
Learn how to [k]fold[/k] the fan with only one [c=hand ]hand [/c]- in the other hand you have to hold a [c=???]white feather[/c]. The [p]fairy[/p]<span style="color:#ffaa00;"> </span>will otherwise cosider you a [p]jerk[/p][c= feather ] [/c](if you can't do it with one hand).
It's just a [c=hole 穴 ]hole[/c], but he [c= feel wronged 屈]feels wronged [/c]when you call it so, he calls it [k]cave[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]doesn't want it to be a hole that he keep his [p]cow [/p]in.
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]statue was made of a [c= jade block 圭]jade block [/c]- a quite expensive [k]doll[/k]. But they [p]fairy [/p]doesn't care, she gives it to the child (to stop the [p]waaa[/p],waaa).
[c= every 每]Every [/c]time he sees the [c=sun 日 ]sun[/c] he hopes it will not be an [k]unlucky [/k]day. Since he started having nightmares about a [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]tampering with his [p]hifi[/p], he is never happy anymore.
The [c=thread ]thread [/c]was cut into tiny little [c= piece 段]pieces[/c], he is trying to synthetise [k]satin [/k]somehow. Even thought he fails, the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]produces at least an artifical [p]dandelion[/p].
Could you fix my [k]tail[/k]? I have some [c= wool <span style="color:#ffaa00;">毛</span>]wool [/c](to be added to his tail), I took it from a [c=corpse <span style="color:#ff0000;">尸</span> ]corpse[/c]. &quot;[p]Wait [/p]just a moment.&quot; she responds to [p]Teddy[/p].
The [c=man with a stick ]man with a stick [/c]tried [c= tap]tapping [/c]his heel, but it was [k]lengthy[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]suggest to him doing more [p]yoga [/p]practice.
In the atmosphere of [c= plenty 畐]plenty[/c], even on a [c=towel 巾 ]towel [/c]there is a [k]number of pictures [/k](of fairies). The [p]fairy [/p]cooks some [p]food [/p](for you after you bathe).
He wanted his every [c=step forward ]step forward [/c]to be [c= upright 正]upright [/c]on this [k]journey[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]wants look fancy, even when going through a [p]jungle[/p].
He filled his ([c=(trady) car 車 ]trady) car[/c] full with [c= feather 羽 ]feathers [/c]- and then parks under a [c= tent]tent[/c]. He wants to produce [k]writing brushes[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]laughts and asks if it is a traditional [p]Han [/p]custom.<br /><br />约翰 - Johannes
During a [c= &quot;happy camping&quot; 桼]happy camping[/c], he took some [c=water 氵 ]water [/c]he needed to correct his painting with - he [k]lacquered [/k]an image of a [p]giant[/p] eating a [p]cheese[/p].
When the [c= moon 月]moon [/c]is [c=good 良 ]good[/c], it is [k]bright and clear[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]likes to [p]languish [/p]under the good moon.
<br />The [c= sun 日]sun [/c]goes down, and the all the [p]Huns[/p]<span style="color:#ff0000;"> </span>begin to [k]lose consciousness [/k](mostly because they fall asleep). But the [p]giant[/p]<span style="color:#ff0000;"> </span>is still awake - he prefers not to sleep by twilight (nomen - omen: his [c=surname 氏 ]surname[/c] is not Hun).
The [c= heart 心]heart [/c]doctor does [c=as / if 若 ]as if [/c]he were asleep. It is an attempt to stop being [k]vexed[/k]. Didn't work against [p]Teddy[/p], so he tries menacing: [p]Rrrr....[/p]
She sees no other choice that to go to the [c=mound ⻖]mound [/c]and [c= conceal 𠃊 ]conceal [/c]herself there. She is already the [c=  third 丙<br>]third [/c]one that considers herself so much [k]ugly[/k]. A [p]dwarf [/p]comes and asks: &quot;What is this for a place? A [p]local [/p]monster lounge?&quot;
The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]is keeping [p]statistics[/p]: of how many [k]downcast [/k]people he met. (He is guarding the town's social health). [c=???]Abruptly[/c], all of a sudden, a [c=heart 心 ]heart [/c]of one of these downcast ppl fails, and he dies. (The ghostly dwarf mumbles about bad influence of being downcast to your hear).
The [c=ghost 鬼 ]ghost [/c]has [c= not yet 未]not yet [/c]turned into a [k]demon [/k](but is just about to do it). The [p]dwarf [/p]thinks it would be good to escape the [p]maze[/p] before that happens.
The [c= heavenly body 辰]heavenly body [/c]was an [c=inch 寸 ]inch [/c]away from the expected place - to the [k]dishonor [/k]of the royal astronomer. But it was because [p]Teddy [/p]had brought him some [p]rum [/p]before.
The [c=gate 门 ]gate [/c]leading to the [c= market 市]market [/c]was very [k]cacophonous [/k](everytime it opened or closed). The [p]dwarf [/p](driven almost crazy by it) tryies cleaning the hinges with an acid made of [p]NaOH[/p].
Looking for an artifical [c=foot ⻊ ]foot [/c]in the [c= store 店]store[/c]: &quot;This one were good, if the [k]tiptoe[/k] would not be broken...&quot; The [p]two Teddies [/p]leave the shop and go rather to the [p]dentist [/p](to get some artifical teeth instead).
You read some [c=words 讠 ]words[/c], but since you have an empty [c= stomach 胃]stomach [/c]you don't really care what the [k]designate[/k]. It is actually a love letter from the [p]dwarf [/p]to [p]Wei[/p].
The [c=fire 火 ]fire [/c]burned the [c= insect 虫]insect [/c]to death - even when it was just a [k]candle[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]burries it in a [p]jewelled [/p]box. (So much ado about an insect...)
He puts his [c=ear 耳 ]ear [/c]on the [c= fire 火]fire[/c](place). He is [k]devoted [/k]to learn the sound by heart. [p]Teddy [/p]adds more [p]gunk[/p] to keep the fire burning.<br /><br />(In dict only the compound 耿耿 means devoted, but the others are ambiguous).
He pretendes to [c=right hand ]shake hands [/c]with him, but while the other one reaches his hand, he holds a [c= dagger]dagger[/c] there already - it was a [k]trick[/k]. But the [p]dwarf[/p] parries him with his [p]shield[/p].
The [p]two dwarfs [/p]were commisioned to [k]embrodier [/k]some decorations - for the coming [p]show [/p]- with some [c= handsome (秀)]handsome[/c]... They murmel as they work with the [c=???]threads[/c].
They were sending food down on a [c=thread ]thread [/c]- [c= to feed a prisoner 昷]to feed the prisoner[/c]. And he exploited it - there was a [k]tangled hemp [/k]in his cell (collecting the thread for his escape). The [p]giant [/p]will help him hide in the prisoner's [p]Union[/p].
The [c= looks 貌]looks [/c]of the [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]were not so nice. He alwas [k]despised [/k]desert countries. But the [p]two Teddies [/p]like it, as they like to chase the [p]mouses[/p].
He is about to buy the [c=horse 马 ]horse [/c]but in the last moment he [c= hesitate 夋]hesitates[/c]: is it really such a [k]spirited horse [/k](as the seller describes)? (And really,) the [p]dwarf [/p]tries to take advantage of the [p]junior[/p].
The [c=water 水 ]water [/c]wrecked havoc on the [c= parcel 包]parcel [/c]- that's why it feels quite... [k]spongy[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]tries fixing that with a special [p]powder[/p].
&quot;Can you [k]trail [/k]anything with your [c=hand ]hand[/c]?[c=???] Also [/c]a[c= cloud ] cloud[/c]?&quot; The [p]ghostly giant[/p] says: &quot;I can do it even with my [p]toes[/p]!&quot;
He [c= {analyze <span style="color:#ff0000;">析}</span>]analyzes [/c](in the laboratory) the whole night. But first when the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]rises, [k]understanding [/k]comes. &quot;It's the [p]giant[/p]'s [p]sheep[/p]'s product!&quot;
Well, the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]goes [c= deeply 覃]deeply[/c] in a [k]deep pool[/k]. That's why [p]fairy [/p]has to announce warning reguralry by the [p]tannoy[/p] (so that nobody drowns there).
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]declared her[c= self 己]self [/c]as the [k]imperial concubine[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]only shakes the head, asking if she is a [p]famous [/p]person.
In the times of [c=peace 安 ]peace[/c], they went to check the [c= tree 木]trees [/c]and logged their status in a [k]file[/k]. One was probably damaged by the [p]dwarf[/p]'s [p]anchor[/p].
He cuts [c=tree 木 ]the tree [/c]a few times with his [c= axe 斤]axe[/c], but then, instead of <span style="font-style:italic;">separating </span>(the trunk from the stump), he starts to [k]analyze[/k] it. The boss commands the [p]giant [/p]from the [p]sheeps [/p]to the forest, to replace him.
[c= between 介]Between [/c]all the [c=grass 艹 ]grass[/c], a straight line of [k]mustard [/k]could be seen. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]get [p]jealous [/p]of the grass, as they never get mustard in the food.
His [c=heart 心 ]heart [/c]is pumping, he puffs out [c= air 气]air[/c]... he has [k]anger [/k]against a common enemy. The [p]dwarf [/p]has broken their [p]kite[/p]!
If he's full of [k]anxiety[/k], [c= especially 尤]especially [/c]if his [c=heart ]heart [/c]is pumping, the [p]giant [/p]tries to solve it with[p] yoga [/p]practices.
He wants to make a new [k]edition [/k]of his book. But they are [c= {opposed <span style="color:#00aa00;">反</span>}]opposed [/c]to it. &quot;Please,please, print at least a [c=slice 片 ]slice [/c]of it.&quot; But he gets thrown out - quite rudely - [p]Teddy[/p] has to treat him with [p]bandages[/p].
[c= advance quickly 夲]Advance quickly [/c]until you reach a place marked in [c=white 白 ]white [/c]- then you have reach the [k]marsh [/k](and better advance slowly). The [p]giant [/p]couldn't join the military drill as he had [p]gout[/p].
After the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]flew into the [c= valley 谷]valley[/c], kids started going there to [k]bathe[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]playing [p]ukulele [/p]likes to bathe there too (especially in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain </span>- he is a strange person).
A bloody [c= dagger 戈]dagger [/c]lying around, only the [c=the sound of the wind 翏 ]sound of the wind[/c] can be heard... The remnants of a [k]massacre[/k]. And the [p]dwarf[/p] thought the news about hostiles were [p]lurdiculous[/p]...
&quot;Why do they always build [c= temple 寺]temples [/c]on a [c=mountain 山 ]mountain[/c]?&quot; &quot;Not only on a mountain, but on the [k]peak [/k]of the mountain! Otherwise people - like the [p]dwarf [/p]selling [p]jacuzzis [/p]- would bother them too much.&quot;
The [c=gold 金 ]gold [/c]has been [c= {linked up 连}]linked up [/c]in a golden [k]chain[/k]. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]discuss if they should [p]lend [/p]it (or not).
A few days after the [c= &quot;birth&quot; 㐬]birth[/c], she sits under the [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c], [k]combing [/k]her hair. The baby is now resting in the [p]giant[/p]'s [p]shoe[/p].
(A postman championship): The have to wait [c=until <span style="color:#0000ff;">至</span> ]until[/c] the referee [c= tap]taps[/c], the have to [k]convey [/k]the package as soon as possible. The winner will recieve a bath in a [p]jacuzzi[/p], prepared beforehand by the [p]dwarf[/p]. (So there's not much water anyway.)
As they started pouring [c= fuel used for sacrifices 尞]the fuel used for sacrifices [/c]before the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave, there was a [k]clear sound [/k]coming out. The [p]two fairies [/p]add more fuel in hope to make it [p]louder[/p].
(They used a trick at the custom check:)<br />With [c=mutual assistance 襄 ]mutual assistance [/c]- they carry it in the [c= middle 中 ]middle[/c], they manage to [c= cover 冖]cover [/c]they [k]sack[/k]. Inside is what the [p]fairy [/p]wants to smuggle to [p]Nankey[/p].
&quot;How to use your [c=words ]words [/c]to [k]cajole [/k]- and common [c=???]pitfalls[/c] (to avoid).&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]wants to sell you the manual with the words: &quot;Somebody so good as you will certainly not miss such a [p]chance[/p].&quot;
It was a [k]common [/k]knowledge that [c=Harry ]Harry [/c]was about to sell the [c= valley 谷]valley[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]wants to prevent it - she wants no [p]supermarket [/p]there.
The dwarf is writing a letter to his former girlfriend - and he paints a big [c=heart ]heart [/c]next to the &quot;[c= yours truly]yours truly[/c]&quot; - hoping the she will [k]become aware[/k] of the [p]wound [/p]she left in the [p]dwarf[/p]'s heart.
The [c= pitchpipe 吕]pitchpipe [/c]was [c= cover 冖 ]covered [/c]with [c=grass 艹 ]grass[/c]. It was marking the a place for the [k]camp[/k], however it seems that they have forgotten it here. &quot;Take it to [p]Ying [/p]as a curiosity.&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]suggests.<br /><br />vs: 宫
Please go in the same [c= direction 方]direction [/c]as [c=Harry ⺅ ]Harry[/c] and [k]copy [/k]his footsteps exactly. [p]Teddy[/p] wants to know the path to [p]Fang [/p]the dog's home.
Everybody was [c=occupied 占 ]occupied[/c], all were practising with their [c= dagger 戈]daggers[/c]. There was a [k]battle [/k]impending. The [p]dwarf [/p]king decided to take [p]Janit [/p]by force.
The [c= pigeon]pigeon [/c]has a [c=tooth 牙 ]tooth [/c]that is very [k]elegant[/k]. Or had one, until [p]Teddy [/p]pulled it out with a [p]yarn[/p].
The [c= dish 皿]dish [/c]was &quot;[c=division 分 ]divided[/c]&quot; accidentally, so they collect the fragments and put the into the [k]basin[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]collects the rests with a telescopic [p]pen[/p].
What [c=place 处 ]place [/c]we came to? This is not a [c= mouth 口]mouth [/c]of a cave. What a [k]misfortune[/k]! The [p]two dwarfs [/p]angrily say they have no time for such stupid [p]jokes[/p].
He was holding (the livestock) with one [c=hand ]hand[/c], and with the [c= other 另]other[/c]? he was beating it with a [k]cane[/k]. [p]Ghostly Teddy[/p] (supposed to guard the livestock - but not getting it that they are trying to kidnap it): &quot;Why don't you use [p]guy [/p]ropes?&quot;
The soldier [c= stand <span style="color:#0000ff;">立</span>]stands[/c] [k]erect[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]wants to test, how [c=firm (坚 without 土) ]firm [/c]he is (in his service). So he jumps on his [p]shoe[/p].
This <span style="font-style:italic;">timber </span>was [c= only just 才]only just [/c]a [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]- we need a lot of [k]material [/k](for the building). The [p]fairy [/p]is suggesting to cut it in [p]style [/p](next time).
Is this [c=amber 珀 ]amber[/c]? No, it's a [c= stone 石]stone [/c]- so it has to be [k]green jade[/k]. Actually, it's just a [p]bean [/p]forgotten by a [p]dwarf[/p].
He had no [c=food 饣 ]food[/c], and because he wanted to [c=  avoid 免 ]avoid [/c]civilization, the only thing he could eat were [c= ice crystals]ice crystals[/c]. He was so [k]gluttonous[/k]. As the [p]fairy [/p]sees that she gives him a second [p]chance[/p].
Considering how [c=evil 歹 ]evil [/c]he was, the priest was suprised he had any [c= visitor 宾]visitor [/c]at all at his [k]funeral[/k]. He was so hated that the [p]dwarf [/p]even suggested burring him in a recycle [p]bin[/p] instead.
The [p]giant [/p]is implanting some [c=rice <span style="color:#00aa00;">米</span> ]rice [/c]into the [c= bookcase <span style="color:#00aa00;">且</span>]bookcase [/c]- to make the material more [k]coarse[/k]. He was hired by the [p]tsukuba [/p](she prefers coarse enviroments).
They went to look for the [c= heart 心]heart [/c]doctor who followed the man wearing the [c=tiger stripes 虍 ]tiger stripes[/c], just because he was so [k]concerned [/k]about his heart.<br />The [p]dwarf [/p]thinks it is [p]lurdiculous [/p]to do it in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]plays with the [c=  pitchpipe 吕]pitchpipe[/c]. But his [k]companions [/k]get tired of it soon. [p]Teddy [/p]suggets: &quot;Why don't you go [p]look [/p]outside in the <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain </span>instead?!&quot;&quot;
The [c= to store 屯]stored [/c]the [c=gold ]gold [/c]in the safe, but were too [k]blunt [/k]to lock it. The [p]dwarf [/p]calls them [p]dunces [/p]as he discovers that.
The [c= pigeon]pigeon [/c]loves items made of [c=gold ]gold[/c] - until he once sat accidentally on a (golden) [k]awl[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]hurries there and takes him to relax in a [p]jacuzzi [/p](for pigeons).
Take this [c=thread ⺰]thread [/c]and don't [c= dawdle 夌]dawdle[/c]! You need to fix this [k]damask [/k]for the [p]fairy [/p]without [p]lingering[/p]!
The [k]barbarians [/k]have a [c=big ]big [/c]meaning of them[c=???]selves[/c]. The [p]fairy [/p]says: &quot;To defeat so proud people will be [p]easy[/p].&quot;
Please gives me a [c=hand ]hand [/c]sorting out which [c= twins 双 ]twins [/c]are [c= twins 双 ]twins [/c](and which only seems so) and [k]collect [/k]the photos here. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]will then commemorate them in the [p]dom [/p]he is guarding.
The [c=sheep 羊  ]sheep [/c]had [c= &quot;fomentation&quot;]fomentation [/c]on - [k]Fuxi [/k]took good care even for sheep. The [p]giant [/p]is happy and hopes his [p]sheep [/p]will soon be healthy.
He wanted to turn his [c=house ]house [/c]into a [k]palace [/k](or perhaps a <span style="font-style:italic;">temple</span>). He started by hanging some [c=???]pitchpipes [/c]in his house. The [p]giant [/p]prepares the palace [p]gong[/p].<br /><br />vs: <span style="color:#ff0000;">官</span>　- an official<br />vs: 殿 - palace hall
He [k]caresses [/k]the food[c= -less <span style="color:#ffaa00;">无</span>]less[/c] [p]Teddy [/p]with his [c=hand ]hand[/c]. Teddy says: &quot;Could you give me some [p]food [/p]also?&quot;
They were trying to synchronize themselves with a [k]pitchpipe [/k]in their [c=mouth ]mouth [/c](his and her [c= mouth]mouth[/c]). But they spit it away (out of the window) soon, and send [p]Teddy [/p]to go [p]look [/p]for in (in the <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>) (as a pretext for sending him away).
A [c= crow 乌]crow [/c]sits at the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave, sings: &quot;[k]hummmmmmm[/k]&quot; (she finds it funny to hummm this way).  The [p]giant [/p]comes out and [p]whoops [/p]when he sees that it is a crow.
The [c=scholar 士 ]scholar [/c]suggestes to [c= cover 冖 ]cover [/c]the [c= industry 业]industry [/c]areas with [k]pots[/k].<br>The [p]fairy [/p]seeing that asks: &quot;Who? [p]Who [/p]had such a picturesque idea?&quot;
The calf are often used as a <span style="font-style:italic;">sacrificial victim </span>- so you can sometimes meet [c=cow 牛 ]cows [/c]trying to [c= sell 卖]sell [/c]their own [k]calf [/k](!) The [p]fairy [/p]rescues such a one sold calf and covers it with [p]duvets[/p].
The [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]was decorated with [c= {jade block 圭}]jade [/c]block, to show that this is the ruler's [k]cassia[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]has to guard it, playing [p]guitar [/p]to it every evening.<br /><img src="pastetmt8m1.jpg" /><br /><br />桂鱼 - mandarin fish:<br /><br /><img src="pastescnxnx.jpg" />
What is it? It is small, white - but it is not rice, as it is supposed to be a [c= &quot;riceless meal&quot; 粦]riceless meal[/c]. It tastes like a [c=stone 石 ]stone[/c], I hope it is not [k]phosphorus[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]says the small white stuff she always adds to [p]Linecke [/p]is called sugar.
&quot;We need a [c=tree <span style="color:#0000ff;">木</span> ]tree [/c]to make into a [k]cupboard[/k].&quot; &quot;This one?&quot; &quot;No, we need a [c= huge <span style="color:#0000ff;">巨</span>]huge[/c] one.&quot; The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]- guarding the forest - sits on the [p]gate [/p]to the forest colony and watches, that they don't take too much.
The wanted to check, if the [c=earth 土 ]earth [/c]is [c= level 平]level[/c], and should be then called a [k]plain[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]suggests using [p]ping[/p]-pong ball to verify it.
At the restuarant - they have a strange [k]policy[/k]: every visitor is [c=???]thrusted [/c]by a [c=bamboo <span style="font-weight:600; color:#ffaa00;">竹</span> ]bamboo [/c]stick before entry. The [p]dwarf [/p]chef makes than the [p]steak [/p]according how loud he cried.
The [c= fortune teller]fortune teller [/c]is sitting on a [c=tree ]tree[/c]: &quot;You have to live [k]plain and simple[/k] to obtain immortality.&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]says: &quot;It's boring, let's get a bath in a [p]pool[/p]!&quot;<br />(a concept in Taoism.)
In [c=Asia 亚 ]Asia[/c], they smash the [c= heart 心]hearts [/c]of all who they think are [k]evil[/k]. The (evil) [p]dwarf[/p]: &quot;[p]Eeh[/p]...&quot;
When you try to cross a river, where a [c= &quot;vortex&quot; 呙]vortex [/c]can be seen, you can take it for a [c=sign ]sign [/c]of a coming [k]disaster[/k]. Perhaps it would be better to ask the [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]to guard you on your way back to [p]hotel[/p].
Give me a [c=hand 手 ]hand [/c]hiding his [c= cap 弁]cap [/c](in an uncomfortable place) - he [k]disregarded [/k]my authoriy! The [p]dwarf [/p]suggests: &quot;Why don't you smash him with the [p]pan [/p]instead?&quot;
If you need [c=shelter ]shelter [/c]for a [c= car]car[/c], you can drive the cars in to park them in the [k]warehouse [/k](the warehouse was changed into a parking palace temporarily). You just have buy a [p]coupon[/p] from the [p]dwarf[/p].
After the [c= birth 㐬]birth[/c], the baby was [k]neglected[/k]: it was packed only in a [c=bolt of cloth 疋 ]bolt of cloth[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]finds it and packs him in his [p]shoe[/p].
&quot;Can you eat [c= quick <span style="color:#0000ff;">快</span>]quickly[/c] with [c=bamboo <span style="color:#ffaa00;">竹</span> ]bamboo [/c]sticks?&quot; &quot;You mean [k]chopsticks[/k]?&quot; The [p]ghostly dwarf[/p], guarding the table, is borad and plays with a (ghostly) [p]kite[/p].
The [p]giant [/p]is so high, that the [c=moon ]moon [/c]gets offended and hits him into his [k]waist[/k]: &quot;[p]Yaow[/p]! What do you [c= want]want[/c]?&quot;
His [c=heart ⺖]heart [/c]started beating, and he was not able to [c= go 去]go[/c]. Why was he so [k]timid[/k]? Maybe because he remembered that the [p]two dwarfs [/p]will come and [p]check [/p]his identity.
He planted the [c= tooth 牙]tooth [/c]between the [c=grass 艹 ]grass[/c], and it sprouted a [k]bud[/k]! Probably because the [p]yarn [/p]the [p]fairy [/p]used to pull it out was of natural materials.
He pushed a [c= ladle 勺]ladle [/c]down the [c=slide ]slide [/c]- to see if it was really [k]even[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]representing the [p]Union [/p]of Slide producers to certify it afterwards.
The [c=thread ⺰]thread [/c]was bunt, so she [c= decide on 定]decided on [/c]fastening it to a flower. She was quite suprised to find out it [k]burst open [/k]afterwards. But actually it just the [p]dwarf [/p]tries a trick on [p]Janit[/p].
The people [c=opposing 舛 ]opposing [/c]him have bound him to a [c= tree 木]tree [/c]for three days, which he thought of as absolutely [k]brutal[/k]. The [p]two fairies [/p]fly there with a [p]jelly [/p]cake, in hope to console him (after setting him free).
The strange [c=illness 疒 ]illness [/c]caused his [c= skin 皮]skin [/c]to need a lot of energy, so he felt [k]weary [/k]all the time. The [p]fairy [/p]prepares a magical [p]pizza [/p]for him as a cure.
(an emotinal situation) &quot;Put your [c=spear 矛 ]spear [/c]down, [c= now 今]now[/c]! Don't be so [k]vainglorious [/k]to kill me!&quot; The [p]giant[/p]: &quot;I will give you a bottle of [p]jin[/p] if you let her go!&quot;
<br />Com'on, we have to [k]drain [/k]the [c=water ]water [/c]from the [c=???]woods[/c]. You'll get a icecream from me and [p]Linecke [/p]from the [p]fairy[/p].<br />冰淇淋 - icecream
The [c=bastard 庶 ]bastard [/c]was standing on the [c= road]road[/c], trying to [k]screen off[/k] his origins. The [p]giant[/p] says to him: &quot;Don't worry, I'm a [p]jerk [/p]too.&quot;
First a [c=thumb tack ]thumb tack [/c]flies towards his [c= eye 目 ]eye[/c], which he parries with his [c= dagger 戈]dagger[/c]. But at the time is already a [k]lance [/k]pointing at him. The [p]two fairies [/p]try to resolve the situation with speech in their [p]jargon[/p].<br />(note upper part of the character is equal as in 夏)
Ah, the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]is shining again - if you [c= un- 非]un-[/c]cover your [k]calf of leg, [/k]we can check the wound. The [p]fairy [/p]is a [p]famous[/p] healer.<br />腓力 - Philip
The [k]brutish [/k]woman [c=???]sent them out [/c]to <span style="font-style:italic;">spill </span>our only [c=water ⺡]water[/c]! Fortunately, they are stopped by the [p]porcupines [/p]dispatched by the [p]giant[/p].
The date, when the [c=rice 米 ]rice [/c]was supposed to be harvested, was set up [c= strict 厉]strict[/c]. Unfortunately, he used a calendar for a different year (so he missed the correct date) - the result was a very [k]coarse rice[/k]. But he finds a solution - he started throwing the rice to at [p]dwarf [/p]- who has to [p]leap[/p] (at least some fun when the rice is no use).
There was a [c= leather 韦]leather [/c]jacket lying on the [c=road ]road[/c]. It seems that the kid [k]disobeyed [/k](and threw his jacket away). The [p]fairy[/p]: &quot;No wonder, who would want to carry around so much [p]weight[/p].&quot;
Her [c=husband <span style="color:#ff0000;">夫</span> ]husband [/c]wants to [c= see <span style="color:#0000ff;">见</span>]see [/c]where they are - so he looks on a [k]compass [/k](but he can't find that out anyway). But then - he spots the [p]ghostly giant [/p]on a [p]gate[/p]<span style="color:#ff0000;"> </span>- he provides directions for the lost one, guarding the travelers.
The one who first make fire using only the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]will win. My <span style="font-style:italic;">elder brother </span>[c= compare with 比]compares [/c]himself with my [k]descendant[/k]. But the [p]giant [/p]is [p]kunning [/p]- he covers the sun so that neither can win.
If your body is not [c= flexible <span style="color:#ffaa00;">柔</span>]flexible [/c]enough, you can ask a woman's [c=hand ]hand [/c]for a [k]massage[/k]. The other possibility is to get caught by the [p]fairy[/p] - she will then [p]roast [/p]you (you won't mind your not flexible then as you'll be dead).
The [c= pigeon]pigeon [/c]got a [c=wound ]wound [/c](while flying round the town). He flies to visit the [p]two fairies[/p]: one says: &quot;You should be glad you didn't end up in two [k]chunks[/k].&quot; The other one offers him a [p]jelly[/p] cake (as relief).
The gardnener spreads the [c=grass ]grass [/c]so much, that it's [c= pervading 溥]pervading [/c]even up to the [p]fairy[/p]'s garden. She says: &quot;Hey, [p]borče[/p], a little [k]frivolous[/k], huh?&quot;
The [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]wanted to sleep, but the [c= insect 虫]insect [/c]didn't leave him [k]alone[/k]. He even bit the [p]duvets[/p] the [p]fairy [/p]gave him.
Your [c=father 父 ]father [/c]gives you an [c= axe 斤]axe[/c]: &quot;Take this [k]hatchet [/k]and deliver it to the kitchen, please.&quot; As you bring it, [p]Teddy [/p]jumps out happy he cut the meat for the [p]foo yong[/p]!
In the day, they use a [c=net ]net[/c] (to cover the doors from insects), in the [c= evening 夕]evening[/c], they use [k]gauze [/k](as an advertisment promo).<br />The [p]fairy [/p]buys some for a dress for [p]Lolita[/p].
&quot;All the time since I asked you to give me a [c=hand ⺘]hand[/c], you are like this. Do you have [c= flea 蚤]fleas [/c]or what? Why do you keep [k]scratching [/k]yourself?&quot; But the [p]giant[/p][p] [/p]is scratching his head, because he is thinking of his friend [p]Salo[/p].
The [c= wrap 勹 ]wrapped [/c]the [c=insect 虫 ]insect [/c]in a [c= net 罒]net [/c]and exported in from [k]Sichuan [/k](it must have been quite a big insect, when in can be wrapped in a net...). [p]Teddy[/p] lends him his [p]shoes [/p](so that it won't get cold outside Sichuan).
His [c=snout ]snout [/c]looked like on [c= fire]fire [/c]- but he didn't mind. Probably because it was only a [k]spirit[/k]. But the [p]fairy [/p]is not afraid and doesn't mind to [p]linger [/p]there.
He wanted to [c= to prolong 延]prolong [/c]the duty time of the [c=water ⺡]water[/c], so he experienced by mixing it with various [k]salivary [/k]liquids (grr!). The [p]two fairies[/p] help him by bringing in information from their [p]šanons[/p].
(Showing a photo). Here am [c=I 我 ]I[/c], this is my pet [c= bird 鸟]bird[/c], and this is my [k]goose[/k]. The [p]fairy[/p] (finding photographing with animals weird): &quot;[p]eeee[/p]&quot;.
When the [c=two kings ]two kings [/c]meet, the director yells &quot;[c= now]Now[/c]!&quot; when they enter the dinning room - and a sound of [k]zither [/k]and other <span style="font-style:italic;">musical instruments</span>. The [p]fairy [/p]the then razes the guests [p]chin[/p].<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">钢</span><span style="color:#ffaa00;">琴</span> - piano
She was very [c=nimble 敏 ]nimble [/c]at usage of the [c= thread 糸]thread[/c]. She could even weave [k]complicated [/k]things. The [p]fairy [/p]orders a [p]fan [/p](with complicated patterns).
He implanted [c=hay <span style="color:#ffaa00;">刍</span> ]hay [/c]into his [c= skin <span style="color:#ffaa00;">皮</span>]skin[/c]. After he removes them, [k]wrinkles [/k]can be seen. He goes then through the city, pretending to be old. It's a weird [p]joke[/p] by the [p]dwarf[/p].
The [k]wife of father's younger brother [/k](Jana) [c=???]tried [/c]an other [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c](in court). That's why [p]Teddy [/p]began to [p]shun [/p]both of them.
His [c=foot ⻊ ]foot [/c]was already aching - he has already been in a [c= {reside / number of bedrooms 居}]number of bedrooms[/c], but never in one where you had to [k]squat [/k]all the time. It's probably because usually a [p]dwarf [/p]- the [p]judo [/p]expert - sleeps here (and practices judo).
The [c=container ]containter [/c]for the [c= king 王]king [/c]didn't contain what it was supposed to! They have to [k]amend [/k]it quickly. That's why they send a [p]ghostly giant [/p]driving a [p]kangaroo [/p]for the highest possible speed.
They struck an [c= electricity 电]electricity [/c]cable in the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of a [k]toad[/k]. &quot;How many [p]minutes [/p]do you think she will survive 220V?&quot; [p]Teddy[/p] asks.
He wanted to get in, so he tries to scare (and disgust) him by looking with [c= droop 垂]droop [/c]eyes, and then opens his [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]and starts to [k]salivate[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]only laughts coldly and contiues to guard the entry to the [p]tower[/p].
It is already the [c= tenth 癸]tenth [/c]time he opened the [c=eye 目 ]eye [/c]and asked (the wind): Why do we have to remain ever [k]separated[/k]?&quot; A [p]ghostly fairy [/p]appears and says: &quot;You know yourself what is best for the [p]kid[/p].&quot;
There was a real human [c=heart ⺖]heart [/c]inside the [c= bundle 束]bundle[/c]. The more she thinks about it the more she [k]get frightened[/k]. The [p]Teddy [/p]stops his [p]song [/p]as he sees it, too.
You wonder why the [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]is crawling among the [c= sprout 苗]sprouts[/c], and then you notice it is a [k]cat[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]got one to catch the [p]mouses[/p].
After he ate his last [c= &quot;riceless meal&quot; 粦]riceless meal[/c], he looked up the [c=mountain 山 ]mountain [/c]that was the last mark in the [k]sheer mountain range[/k]. But it is the only place where the [p]Linecke [/p]baked by the [p]fairy [/p]can be still bought, so he moves on.
With [c= mutual assistance <span style="color:#ff0000;">襄</span>]mutual assistance[/c], they managed to [k]inlay [/k]the entire room with [c=gold 金 ]gold[/c]. The [p]two giants [/p]are preparing the reception hall for the guests from [p]Shanghai[/p].
&quot;What's the [c= difficulty 难]diffuculty[/c]? Just jump into the [c=water 氵 ]water[/c].&quot; &quot;I would rather stay here on the [k]beach[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]destroyed the tannoy with his head accidentally, so you can't get early warnings by the [p]tannoy [/p]now.&quot;
The [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]decided to go on regime, until he'll get [c= half 半]half [/c]so [k]fat [/k]as now. He ordered the [p]dwarf [/p]to stop suppling him the [p]pancakes[/p].
He wanted to go by the [c=road ]road[/c], until he saw an [c= omen 兆]omen [/c]and stopped in fear. It is impossible to [k]escape [/k]from the [p]fairy[/p]'s [p]tower [/p]then?
A [c=dog 犬 ]dog [/c]may be called a [k]doggie [/k](especially at [c=???]May [/c]celebrations). [p]Teddy [/p]calls his doggie: &quot;[p]Go[/p] with me!&quot;
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]has to keep his [c= esteem <span style="color:#0000ff;">尚</span>]esteem [/c]high, [k]in case[/k] [p]Teddy [/p]would get [p]tangled[/p]<span style="color:#00aa00;"> </span>again in the better circles.
Who did [c= un 非]un[/c]-lock the [c=container ]container[/c]? It was the [k]bandit[/k]. All are scared, only [p]Teddy[/p] secretly hopes to become a [p]famous [/p]bandit, too, someday.
You cannot go to the [c=palace hall 殿 ]palace halls [/c]like this, not even when only the [c= moon 月]moon [/c]is shining! You'll have to get enough clothes that cover at least your [k]buttocks[/k]! The [p]fairy [/p]lends you a [p]tunic[/p].
There was [c=water 水 ]water [/c]in the [c= barn 仓]barn[/c], but the worker didn't understand it. He was only wondering, why the hay has such an [k]azure [/k]color. The [p]giant [/p]is confused as he can't pick it up with [p]Stanges[/p].
When he was driving over the [c= winding 宛]winding [/c]road, he slowed down not to make the [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]shake too much - he was [k]tactful[/k]. [p]Teddy[/p], however, loves speed, so he drove there at maximal speed with his [p]van[/p].
&quot;What kind of [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]grows on the water in the [c= canal 渠]canals[/c]?&quot; &quot;I believe it is [k]lotus[/k].&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]answers, [p]chewing [/p]one in pouring rain.
&quot;What [c=catlike beast 豸 ]catlike beast [/c]can be hardly eaten with a [c= ladle 勺]ladle [/c](even though its first letter is L too)?&quot; A [k]leopard[/k]! The [p]dwarf [/p]will [p]bow[/p] to you if you manage to kill one with bare hands.
The only [c=work 工 ]work [/c]he had to do was to collect [c= seashell贝]seashells [/c]as a [k]tribute[/k] (to the water king). Everytime he brings it in, the [p]dwarf [/p]rings the ceremonial [p]gong[/p].
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c](actually a girl) who [c= die young 夭]died young [/c]was very [k]enchanting [/k](even thought there was something <span style="font-style:italic;">witchy </span>about her). As the [p]giant [/p]goes around the coffin, it starts to shake. He yells: &quot;[p]Yaoh[/p]!&quot; and starts running away.
If you hold a [c=&quot;snake&quot; 已 ]snake [/c]in [c= two hands <span style="color:#00aa00;">廾</span>]two hands[/c], it is quite easy to [k]distinguish [/k]if it is poisonous or not (depending on if you die after a bite). The [p]dwarf [/p]objects that it is not so [p]easy[/p].
Go to the [c=house ]house [/c]marked with [c= jade]jade[/c]. There is a [p]Teddy [/p]that will [p]bow [/p]to you if you come ornated with [k]gem[/k]s.
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]should be [c= shameful <span style="color:#00aa00;">丑</span>]shameful [/c]because of her clothing. But she wasn't, probably because she was still just a [k]little girl[/k]. The [p]two giants [/p]take her back home - unfortunately her father is a [p]notorious [/p]drinker.
&quot;Go in the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave, and tell my of what [c= category 属]category [/c]it is, I [k]enjoin[/k]!&quot; [p]Teddy[/p] obeys and as he goes out, he reports: &quot;I've found some [p]jewels [/p]inside!&quot;
This [c=house ]house [/c]was only a [c= tree 木]tree [/c]before the [k]Song dynasty [/k]came. The [p]dwarf [/p]sings a [p]song [/p]about the Songs.
Give me some [c=gold 钅 ]gold [/c]to [c= attract 勾]attract [/c]some fish. We just need to ornate the [k]hook [/k]here (and it will attract the fish)... The [p]giant[/p] (who is hungry and wants the fish) says: &quot;[p]Go[/p],go go!&quot;
If you [c=offend ]offend [/c]at the [c= outer limits 冂 ]outer limits [/c]by [c= pile up (一 on top of 口)]piling up [/c]a lot of iron, you will be cooked in an [k]iron cauldron[/k]! The [p]fairy [/p]will convert a [p]girder [/p]to an iron cauldron for you.
He sees a [c=sign 示　]sign [/c]of [c= axe 斤]axe [/c]in the sky. He [k]implores[/k]: &quot;Please, please, may the [p]fairy [/p]give me some [p]cheese[/p]!&quot;<br>(a very logical story, huh?)
If you break the [c= words 言]words [/c]of your [k]oath [/k]I will [c=???]break [/c]you! The [p]dwarf[/p] is [p]shining[/p] his axe already.
The [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]stopped shining. [c= {but 旦}]But[/c]...but... it [k]galls [/k]me. How can I now make the [p]Teddy [/p]admire by [p]dandelions[/p]?
As he got so [c=old 老 ]old [/c]he never went out to see the [c= sun 日]sun[/c]. He thinks a [k]man of sixty [/k]is already an old one. The [p]fairy[/p] lures him out to buy some [p]cheese[/p].
Because the [c=water 水 ]waters [/c]crashed in [c= abruptly 奄]abruptly[/c], he got [k]drown[/k]. Too bad for the [p]giant [/p]- he had to [p]yan [/p]to evacuate.
[c= every 每]Every [/c]single of those [c=words ]words [/c]is meant to [k]instruct [/k]him, how the handle every single straw of the [p]hay[/p]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]is guarding him handling the hayproperly.
He is working in a barn - until he spots an [c= insect 虫]insect[/c]. In fury, he throws his [c=pitchfork 叉 ]pitchfork[/c], killing the [k]flea[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]asks: &quot;How can it be, that a [p]zambo [/p]like you hates fleas?&quot;
They [c=bestow 予 ]bestow [/c]a savana to the [c= elephant 象]elephant [/c]- so that he can lead a [k]carefree [/k]life. The [p]dwarf [/p]likes to ride him in the <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, playing [p]ukulele[/p].
(Underwater museum) &quot;Do any [c=insect 虫 ]insects [/c]live [c= below 下]below [/c]the water level?&quot; the kid asks. Yes, but what you see is a [k]shrimp[/k]! Next to them are the [p]two giants [/p]that admire a [p]shark[/p].
You wanted to drink some [c=water ]water [/c]at [c= night 夜]night [/c]- and as it was dark you accidentally took some other kind of [k]liquid[/k]. You wake up as a [p]yetti [/p]sent by the [p]dwarf [/p]is pounding on your door (you overslept as you were drunk - and are late for work (and the dwarf is the boss)).
The ruler of the [c=county without stick 县 ]county without stick [/c]have gradually lost all his [c= hair]hair[/c]. So he got at least a [k]shaggy [/k]dog (good that he can't beat him when he has no stick). The [p]two giants [/p]have to [p]bow [/p]every time the shaggy dog steps in.
They wanted to make a [c=fire 火 ]fire[/c]. [c= 然 however]However[/c], they could not [k]ignite [/k]it. &quot;Good that we spare us the [p]rancid [/p]smell this time.&quot; the [p]fairy[/p] is laughting (it was probably she who sabotaged it).
When you [c= see 见]see [/c]what does the [c= grass 艹 ]grass [/c]before the [c=house ]house [/c]look like, you deduce that the inhabitants lead a very [k]untrammelled[/k] life. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]that guards the [p]canoes [/p]in the backyard, so he can't take care of it.
If you see and [c= omen]omen [/c]under [c=earth ]earth[/c], it's possibly that some [k]scarlet[/k] blood have been shed here, and you will find a <span style="font-style:italic;">bare</span> body burried undergrounds. In everycase report it to [p]dwarf[/p] the butchler (perhaps he'll make some [p]chapati[/p] of the dead body (yup!)).
She tried to [k]gather together [/k]a lot of [c=thread ]thread [/c]- unfortunately they got [c=???]entangled[/c]. The [p]two giants [/p]make [p]jokes [/p]about it only (they don't like working with threads).
Is it [c=ok 行 ]ok [/c]to add some more [c= water 氵]water[/c]? We need to [k]amplify [/k]the volume. [p]Teddy [/p]has recently got [p]yan [/p]to be a physicist.
The [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]was [c= linked up 连]linked up[/c] in such a way that it looked like a [k]ziziphus lotus[/k]. To make the atmosphere perfect the [p]two fairies [/p]dispersed the bowls of [p]lentils [/p]around it.
The [p]dwarf [/p]is [c=hold on to 执 ]holding on [/c]to his [p]shallot [/p]- it has the [k]potential [/k]to bring him to [c= power 力]power[/c].
Collect [c=seashell 贝 ]seashells[/c] - but only the [c= tiny 戋]tiny [/c]ones. They can work as [k]inexpensive [/k]parts for the [p]generator [/p]made by the [p]two dwarfs[/p].
A [c=thousand <span style="color:#ff0000;">千</span> ]thousand [/c]have been chosen to go the [c= north <span style="color:#00aa00;">北</span>]North[/c] (a Wonderland) - only the [k]well-behaved[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant[/p] guards the chosen ones - especially against an enviing [p]guy[/p].
They gave a [c=white 白 ]white [/c]soap to the (football) team washrooms, hoping it would last for a [c= seven 七]week.[/c] But after they washed themselves once, it was already [k]dark black[/k]! The [p]dwarf[/p] is swearing that the [p]zambos [/p]made it so dirty.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]goes to the [c= archery contest]archery contest [/c]- he defeated all except the [k]marquis [/k]himself. The (second) price is a night at the [p]hotel[/p] - the [p]fairy [/p]flies him there.<br />Orders of feudal nobility: Duke 公, Marquis 侯, Count 伯, Viscount 子, Baron 男
Before the (small radio controlled) [c=car 车 ]car [/c]had a [c= calamity 害]calamity[/c], it was used by the [p]two fairies [/p]to [k]govern [/k]thier home (it was sent around for errands) - now they have to use a [p]shark[/p].
He tells to the [c=woman 女 ]woman[/c]: &quot;Your [c= eyebrow 眉]eyebrows[/c] are looking like monkey hair.&quot; &quot;Are you trying to [k]flatter[/k] me?&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p]answers: &quot;Of course not, I'm just biology [p]major[/p].&quot; (so he was curious - he was never too skillful in small talk).
He waved his [c=hand ]hand [/c]- and only a few minutes later the [c= visitor 宾]visitor[/c] understood that meant he [k]rejected [/k]him. The [p]dwarf [/p]don't feel like talking to people that otherwise dig recycle [p]bins[/p].
The [c=water ]water [/c](in a river) was extremly [c= long / charming 曼]long [/c]- so people could take water [k]unrestrained[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]likes to sing sad tunes with his [p]mandolin [/p]by the water - and he sings quite <span style="font-style:italic;">charming</span> (considering he's a dwarf).
Is this [c= handle 巴]handle [/c]from a [c=plow 耒 ]plow[/c]? No, from a [k]hoe[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]bought a lot in a [p]bargain[/p].
The [c= lord]lord [/c]picked a [c=tree ]tree [/c]and order to cut it for a [k]pillar [/k]in his new house. The [p]dwarf [/p]draws his [p]jewelled [/p]axe and starts cutting.
He was stocking [c=seashell 贝 ]seashells [/c]at the [c= space between the door and the entrance screen 㝉]space between the door and the entrance screen[/c]: soon he had a nice [k]stockpile[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]hopes that one day he will have a stockpile of [p]jewels [/p]instead.
(A rabbit race.) The [c= rabbit 兔]rabbit [/c]races on a [c=road ]road[/c]. &quot;Outstanding, simply [k]outstanding[/k]!&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p]writes the results in an [p]easel[/p].
The king David - even though he's a [c=monarch <span style="color:#ff0000;">君</span> ]monarch [/c]- had to worry about his [c= sheep <span style="color:#ffaa00;">羊</span>]sheeps[/c]. He takes his [k]flock [/k]out of the grass, because it's <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>. &quot;You don't want our sheeps to look like [p]čuně[/p], he?&quot;, says the [p]fairy[/p], holding the rain with a spell until the sheep pass through. (note pig- not koscher animal)
(In a garten.) A [c= fruit 果]fruit [/c]has fallen on his [c=foot 足 ]foot[/c]. &quot;Oh! My [k]malleolus[/k]!&quot; [p]Ghostly fairy[/p], guarding the garten workers, sends him to have a rest on the [p]hay[/p].
&quot;You had to [c= supervise 监]supervise [/c]the [c=clothing 衤 ]clothing [/c]- and now you bring me only [k]ragged garments[/k]!&quot; &quot;It's the [p]fairy[/p]'s fault - her [p]latern [/p]went off (so I couldn't supervise it).&quot;
The [c=water ]water [/c]in the [c= room 间]room [/c]came all from the [k]mountain stream[/k]. The [p]two dwarf [/p]keep the [p]generator [/p]running to bring in the water.
The [c=words 言 ]words [/c]acclaimed the order to [c= summon 召]summon [/c]all the people - it was the [k]imperial order[/k]. But the [p]dwarf [/p]ignores it and stays at home - watching [p]jousting[/p].
(In pouring rain) [p]Teddy[/p]<span style="color:#00aa00;"> </span>asks his girlfriend: will you [c=accept ]accept[/c] me and be my [c= woman]woman?[/c] The girl-bear spits her [p]chewing[/p]<span style="color:#00aa00;"> </span>gum out and answers: &quot;Yes. I will [k]marry [/k]you.&quot;
If you want a magical [k]mark[/k] on you body, you have to [c= pay <span style="color:#0000ff;">付</span>]pay [/c]for it. You can pay by bringing [p]food [/p]on [c=bamboo <span style="color:#ffaa00;">竹</span> ]bamboo [/c]sticks to the to the [p]fairy[/p].
It had [c=tiger stripes 虍 ]tiger stripes [/c]painted over it's [c= snout]snout[/c]. Somebody has [k]mistreated [/k]it (the pig). Actually, it was the [p]ghostly dwarf[/p], who was angry that it is <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, and got [p]nervous [/p]while guarding the pigstall.
The [c= heart 心]heart [/c]operation was [c=lengthy 攸 ]lengthy [/c]process, especially when one of the doctors was working quite [k]leisurely[/k]. The [p]giant[/p]'s heart failed when he was practicing [p]yoga[/p].
&quot;Did you [c= manage 办]manage [/c]the [c=grass ]grass [/c]garten restaurations? What is that plant over there?&quot; &quot;It's [k]Chinese basil[/k].&quot; The [p]giant [/p]wants to grow it here and sell to [p]supermarkets[/p].<br><img src="pasteqvzoks.jpg" />
There was a [k]remainder [/k]of the [c=food ]food [/c]- also some [c=???]surplus [/c]food. The [p]fairy [/p]left it there because she left suddenly to play [p]ukulele [/p]with her friends
They still sat in the restuarant when the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]started to shine - fortunately, their boss was [c= benevolent 善]benevolent [/c]with the time they were allowed to take [k]meals[/k]. It just happened to get long after the [p]dwarf [/p]served [p]shandy[/p].
The [c=king ⺩ ]king [/c]jumps on the [c= horse 马]horse[/c], racing out of the palace to find an [k]agate [/k]stone. [p]Teddy [/p]told him that's what he needs to become a [p]master [/p](in whatever skill).
The [c= sun 日 ]sun [/c]is [c=cover 冖 ]cover [/c]by a [c= six 六]six[/c]-legged spider, the gates of [k]the underworld [/k]open, <span style="font-style:italic;">dark</span>ness everywhere... But the [p]fairy [/p]doesn't seem to care, she just tries out her new [p]mink [/p]coat.
The [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]on the [c= handle 巴]handle [/c](to the moon sect) was meant to be used only by people that wanted to be <span style="font-style:italic;">fat </span>and [k]fertile[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]will help such people to become [p]famous [/p]too.
This [c=mountain ]mountain [/c]is [c= strange]strange[/c], probably because it is so [k]mountainous[/k]. Or maybe because the [p]fairy [/p]is sitting on the top of it and eating [p]cheese[/p].
The [c=claw 爪 ]claw [/c]was waiting for an [k]adequate [/k]moment to scratch the [c= woman 女]woman[/c]. But fortunately the [p]ghostly Teddy[/p], her guardian, spotted it soon enough and escorted her to the [p]tower[/p].
Her [c= heart]heart [/c]has been [c=scorched 焦 ]scorched [/c]by the sudden event, and even her face is getting still more [k]haggard[/k]. The [p]two fairies [/p]try to cure her with their [p]chowder[/p].
He tries to [c= phanero-(reveal) 显]phanero-(reveal)[/c], why is this place so [k]moist[/k]. The answer: &quot;The [c=water 水 ]water [/c]is here, because the [p]giant [/p]washed his [p]shallots [/p]here.&quot;
He was [c= meditate 仑]meditating [/c]in the [c=car 车 ]car[/c], and suddenly the car [k]turned[/k]. (What a powerful meditation.) But the [p]fairy [/p]thinks it is a trick invented in [p]London[/p].
The [c= words 言]words [/c](on the scroll) were actually the &quot;[c=dispel 辟 ]dispel[/c]&quot; spell. I just wanted to [k]give an example [/k]of magic scrolls, [p]dwarf [/p]the [p]pizza [/p]collector.
As he moved the [c=clothing 衤 ]clothing [/c]down from the matress, he found out that there was a sign on the [k]mattress [/k]that [c=???]dishonored [/c]him very much (the sign said it belonged to somebody else). And unfortunately, exatcly in the moment comes the [p]dwarf[/p], notices it, and gets angry: &quot;[p]Rrrr![/p]&quot;
The [c=unicorn 一 ]unicorn [/c]is trying hard to [k]extinguish [/k]the [c= fire 火]fire[/c]. &quot;[p]Meeeh[/p]&quot; the [p]two dwarfs [/p]only deride him.
The [c=deer 鹿 ]deer [/c]was only eating [c= &quot;riceless meal&quot; 粦]riceless meals[/c], which is why the [k]female unicorn [/k]lost interest in him (she obviously loves rice - as she is white too). The [p]fairy [/p]tries to save their relationship by offering some [p]Linecké[/p].
He decided to [c= consult <span style="color:#ff0000;">参</span>]consult [/c]the [c=heart ]heart[/c]-doctor, because the sound of his heart was quite [k]miserable [/k]lately. [p]Teddy [/p]recommends to him: &quot;Try [p]standing[/p] still on only one leg for 14 minutes.&quot;
He needed some [c=clothing ]clothing [/c]- he used [c= hairs]hairs [/c]to make himself a [k]garment[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]drinks then some [p]shandy [/p]after he finished the knitting.
On the [c= east 东]east [/c]side of the [c=mound ]mound [/c]you could [k]exhibit [/k]anything you wanted. The [p]fairy [/p]exhibits her [p]česnek [/p]of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chen </span>country there.
They were (very) pleasantly suprised that a treasure full of [c=gold 金 ]gold [/c]was hidden on the [c= field 田]field [/c]they had bought. They use some of the gold to produce (and sell) [k]gold inlaid work[/k]. The other of the [p]two dwarfs [/p]sells some of the gold to a [p]dentist[/p].
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]was suprised how [k]meticulous [/k]the [c= child 子]child [/c]is. He has even put [p]Teddy [/p]to sleep in a clean bed ([p]Zzzzzz....[/p])
At sunset, the [c= sun 日]sun[/c] was shining on the [c=water 水 ]water[/c]... What is more beautiful than the [k]Mi river[/k]? The [p]dwarf [/p]says: &quot;[p]Me[/p]! of course.&quot;<br /><br />vs: <span style="color:#00aa00;">汩</span>
A [c=sign 示 ]sign[/c]: &quot;This hall is not a museum [c= department 司]department[/c], but the [k]ancestral hall[/k]!&quot; The [p]fairy [/p]has put this sign there, as she had to keep [p]statistics [/p]of how many people got it wrong.
The [c=horse 马 ]horse [/c]was very [c= tall]tall[/c], making his owner [k]proud[/k]. The [p]two giants [/p]say they must have it in their [p]jousting[/p] stable.
The werewolf is quite unhappy about his condition. &quot;I never heard, that even a [p]bee[/p] could spread the werewolf disease. I guess it works only on [p]dwarfs[/p].&quot; But the [c= moon <span style="font-weight:600; color:#0000ff;">月</span>]moon [/c]is merciful, streches his [k]arm [/k]and [c=???]dispels [/c]him. The werewolf-dwarf than begins to metamorph, his arms first.<br /><br />挥臂力振
The [c=king ⺩ ]king [/c]hates having to cut his [c= beard 胡]beard [/c]every day. Once he comes up with an idea - he'll let [k]Anthozoa [/k]to stonify his beard. The [p]fairy [/p]asks: &quot;[p]Who [/p]could possibly want a king with a coral beard? Who?&quot;
[c= Yuan 袁]Yuan [/c]asked all the [c=dog ⺨]dogs [/c]she saw are so ugly and look like [k]apes[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]changes topic and suggests getting some food - for [p]Yuan [/p]coins.
He [c= to come across 逢]comes across[/c] a [c=thread ]thread [/c]- it's funny, because the [p]dwarf [/p]noticed it's over a [k]seam[/k] in a [p]fungus[/p].
There was a lot of [c= work 工]work [/c]to do in the [c=pottery 缶 ]pottery [/c](factory). Especially making the [k]vats[/k]. It was even considered hiring the [p]giant [/p]with his [p]gang[/p].
[c=cry out 吅 ]Crying out [/c]at the [c= horse 马]horse[/c], [k]scolding [/k]him afterwards... the [p]dwarf [/p]has to be on the [p]market [/p]soon.
Why is there [c=grass ]grass [/c]on the [c= platform 台]platform[/c]? Actually, it's [k]moss[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]prepared it for the [p]tiger [/p](he doesn't like to perform on bare wood).
Use the [c= tip 末]tip [/c](of a pen) to measure the height of the [k]foam [/k]on the [c=water ]water[/c]. If it's higher that the tip, please notify the [p]dwarf [/p]that there is probably some [p]motor [/p]oil in the river. (eh, quasi chemistry :-) )
The [c= pigeon 隹]pigeon[/c] is [k]preserved[/k] from flying away by a [c=???]thread.[/c] The [p]fairy [/p]cuts him free - but he still feels some [p]weight [/p]on his claws (that's what's left of the thread).
The combatant [c= sway 晃]sways [/c]and requests a [c=towel 巾 ]towel [/c]- but it was just a [k]pretext [/k]for getting to the [p]hangar[/p] ([p]ghostly Teddy [/p]guarding the hangar gets excited about it).
This part has [c=not yet 未 ]not yet [/c]been plown. You can see that from the [c= barret]barret [/c]on the [k]plow[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]is too [p]lazy [/p]to work now.
He [c= spit 咅]spit [/c]out his chewing gum and wanted to go with her to the [c=mound ]mound[/c]. &quot;May I [k]accompany [/k]you?&quot; &quot;Only if you [p]pay [/p]me!&quot; the [p]fairy[/p] says.
Some people thought that building a new [c=road ]road [/c](as a highway) might be [c= 屰 &quot;disharmonious&quot;]disharmonious [/c]with the peaceful rural areas. But it was to the [k]contrary [/k]- because [p]dwarf [/p]the engineer used animal [p]knee[/p] bones to build it.<br /><br />&quot;disharmonious&quot; 屰 = feet + mountain 山 + slide. The slide down from a mountain, especially when the animal feet can be seen (of the rabbits sliding down), might seem &quot;disharmonious&quot;.
At [k]sunset[/k], almost [c=???]no(ne)[/c] [c= sun <span style="color:#0000ff;">日</span>]sun [/c]can be seen. The [p]dwarf murmurs[/p] (is in a bad [p]mood[/p])he'll have to use lights again (and pay the electricity).<br />
He had to [c=dispel 辟 ]dispel [/c]the [c= knife 刀]knife [/c]before he could [k]chop [/k]with it again. The [p]giant [/p]had cursed it as he failed to chop his [p]pizza [/p]with it the last time.
(At Christmas) &quot;What [c=fish 鱼 ]fish [/c]is [c= {in 里}]in[/c]?&quot; &quot;It's a [k]carp[/k].&quot; &quot;I think I'll just eat some [p]leek[/p]...&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]opposes.
At the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave, [k]a small worm [/k]crawles out, curious to see if the [c= moon 月]moon [/c]is shining. The [p]giant [/p]throws a [p]yuan [/p]coin on him (he is afraid of worms, even the small ones).
The secret [k]code[/k] has been writted on a [c=stone 石 ]stone[/c], given into a [c= horse 马]horse[/c]'s mouth. [p]Teddy [/p]has to ride it to the [p]market[/p].
The [c=woman 女 ]woman[/c] wanted him to be [c= totally 胥]totally[/c] in his family, and soon he became her [k]son-in-law[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]steps on his [p]shoelances[/p] during the wedding (as he envies him - he wanted to marry the daughter himself).
&quot;These were [c=words 讠 ]words[/c] written before her door.&quot; &quot;[c= a moment 臾]A moment[/c], why would he [k]adulate [/k]her? Perhaps he wants the [p]fairy [/p]to play for him [p]ukulele [/p]in the <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>.&quot;
She painted a big [c=pig 亥 ]pig [/c]over an entire [c= page页]page [/c]- but it's [k]chin [/k]was quite sharp. &quot;I don't think pigs have such sharp chins!&quot; comments. The [p]giant [/p]suggests a trick - painting a pig behind a [p]curtain[/p].
The [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]attracted a lot of [c= attract 勾]attention[/c], as it was to be used to [k]construct [/k]the new town hall. But [p]dwarf [/p]the engineer is not happy, he keeps saying: &quot;[p]Gou [/p]away!&quot;
The [c= first 甲]first [/c]of the [c=container ]containers [/c]here is my favorite [k]casket[/k]. It's because the [p]two fairies [/p]store there bones of a [p]shark[/p].
He had a [c=bamboo ⺮ ]bamboo [/c]stick in his [c= hand ⺘]hand [/c]and [c= go round 匝]went round [/c]the prisoners bound with iron [k]hoops[/k]. The [p]giant[/p] must know who had stolen his [p]goose[/p].
The banker [c= hit 击]hits [/c]a [c=mound ]mound[/c]. Angry, he anounces: &quot;I'll give [k]$6 [/k]to anybody who moves the mound away!&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p]tells him he is [p]lurdiculous[/p].<br /><br /><br />when used as six (fraud-proof) pronounced [p]liù[/p]
&quot;[c=&quot;Your servant&quot; 臣 ]Your servant[/c]&quot; he says as he enters the [c= fortune teller 卜]fortune teller [/c]tent. &quot;Soon, you will get ill and [k]lie [/k]on the bed for the rest of your life!&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p](a court servant) [p]woke [/p]in terror.
He can [c= see 见]see [/c]only a [c=claw 爪 ]claw [/c]hitting around. &quot;What is the monster [k]seeking[/k]?&quot; asks the [p]dwarf[/p]. &quot;[p]MEAT[/p]!&quot; (and attacks him).
The [c=tree ]tree[/c] with his [c= companion]companion[/c] struck down by a lightning and were turned into a [k]shed[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]hopes that the lumberjacks will show [p]punctually [/p]to lunch.
The sick one (r) put a [c=catamaran ]catamaran[/c] over his [c= heart]heart[/c] - in hope he would be [k]healed[/k]. A [p]dwarf[/p]<span style="color:#0000ff;"> </span>playing a [p]ukulele[/p] went by, and jumped in the catamaran (crushing his heart and killing him) (he didn't see him under the catamaran. At least he has a new balade to play with his ukulele...) (in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain </span>btw.)
He was unhappy to see the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]again, as it meant more [c= work 干]work [/c]in the period of [k]drought[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]says [p]Han [/p]should not complain.
The [c= young 幼]young [/c]one found a cavity in the [c=earth 土 ]earth [/c]- &quot;From now on this is my [k]cavity[/k]!&quot;  But then a [p]dwarf [/p]comes in, looking where to place the cables for [p]AOL[/p].
What is this road [c=division 分 ]division [/c]doing here? And a [c= mountain 山]mountain[/c]? There was not supposed to be a [k]fork in road [/k]here. There is something wrong with the [p]chart [/p]the [p]dwarf [/p]drafted us.
It was very [c=bad 歹 ]bad[/c], especially in the [c= center 央]center [/c]of the town. The [k]catastrophe [/k]happened, as the [p]giant [/p]tried to [p]yank[/p] some bad people out of the military bunker.
The pilot of the [c= biplane 二]biplane [/c]sits in a [c=leather 革 ]leather [/c]jacket. But - he crashes in [k]clay[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]has given him too much [p]jin[/p].<br /><br />&quot;cowboy&quot; (席 without shelter) = twenty 廿 + towel 巾<br />leather　革　= twenty 廿　+ shopping basket
&quot;I have some [c=bamboo ⺮]bamboo [/c]sticks here. Could you [c= to prolong 延]prolong [/c]my [k]bamboo mat for sitting[/k], please?&quot; The [p]fairy [/p]has [p]yan[/p] to do it.
&quot;Did you get any [c=illness 疒 ]illnesses [/c]after sleeping in the [c= barn 仓]barn [/c]for such a long time?&quot; &quot;I only got a [k]skin ulcer[/k]. Fortunately, the [p]ghostly giant[/p] guarding the barn noticed it and informed Mr. [p]Chang[/p].&quot;
He takes a [c=step forward 彳 ]step forward[/c], and [c= tap]taps [/c]a [c= pedestal 元 ]pedestal [/c]- to open an entrance into the [c= mountain 山 ]mountain[/c]. &quot;What the [k]micro[/k]chips can do today...&quot; the [p]giant[/p] says to [p]Wei[/p].
A rider had to be chosen for the unicorn. But only the [c=fifth ]fifth [/c]candidate (a [c= woman]woman[/c]) had [k]prestige[/k] enough to be accepted. The [p]giant [/p]lifts her up and says: &quot;[p]Wei[/p][c= unicorn ] [/c](name), show us the power of this unicorn!&quot;
The mischievous boy put some [c=yuan 元 ]yuan [/c]coins over a [c= page 页]page [/c]that was covering an abyss. It was a [k]mischievous [/k]trick (as anybody touching it fell into the abyss.) The [p]fairy [/p]helps recovering a [p]wan [/p](out of the abyss).
At [c=dawn 旦 ]dawn[/c], as you look out of the window, [c= in 里]in [/c]the street, you see [p]two dwarfs [/p][p]languishing[/p] without <span style="font-style:italic;">measure</span>, they have no [k]capacity [/k]to do anything.
With a great [c=dexterity ]dexterity [/c]he was dragging the [c= woman 女]woman [/c]across the [c= cross 十 ]crossroad [/c]- and she turned out to be his [k]wife[/k]! The [p]giant [/p]throws a [p]cheese [/p]at him as he dislikes such behavior.<br />(Hand 彐 pulling a woman 女 by the hair 十.)
He is in [c=water 水 ]water[/c], to wash his [c= skin 皮]skin[/c]. A (giant) [k]wave [/k]comes. But the [p]giant [/p]is borec, he's not afraid, and he practices [p]boxing [/p]at the wave.
He had to [c= endure 禁]endure [/c]having to keep his [c=mouth 口]mouth [/c]closed all the time. He was [k]unable to speak[/k]. He can't even drink the [p]jin [/p]offered to him by the [p]dwarf[/p].<br><br><img src="pastelqg_6w.jpg" />
&quot;[p]Who [/p]is that?&quot; the [p]fairy [/p]gives a puzzle. &quot;It's an [c=insect 虫 ]insect[/c], and has no [c= beard 胡]beard[/c].&quot; &quot;A [k]butterfly[/k]!&quot;
If you try to apply the [c= laughing-gas]laughing-gas[/c] to your [c=hand ]hand [/c](instead of into the mouth), it feels like [k]pinching[/k]. The [p]two giants[/p] want to test if it has the same effect on theirs [p]knees [/p](one applies, the other holds his pants up to expose his knee).
If a [c= senior 尊]senior [/c]asks you to go with him along the [c=road ]road[/c], you should [k]obey [/k]him. The [p]giant [/p]demostrates it on an example of [p]zoons [/p](how they all obey one another).
In the [c=middle 中 ]middle [/c]of the [c= mouth 口]mouth [/c]of the cave is a stream of dirty water. It would be a catastrophe if it would [k]mix [/k]with the clean water of the channel nearby. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guarding the [p]channel [/p]makes sure that it never happens.
He comes to the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of a cave. &quot;Anybody [c= in 里]in[/c]? I had to go a [k]mile [/k]to come here.&quot; He [p]leaps [/p]as the [p]giant [/p]comes out.<br>(also used in foreign words in Mandarin)
An <span style="font-style:italic;">indistinct </span>[c= light 光]light [/c]comes out of his [c=heart ]heart[/c]. He follows it, and notices a [k]flurried [/k]person. It's the [p]ghostly Teddy [/p]guarding a [p]hangar[/p]. &quot;Wanna go in?&quot; asks the flurried looking ghostly Teddy.
After [c= tap]tapping [/c]the [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]repeatedly, a [k]number of pearls [/k]was gained. The [p]fairy [/p]has found her [p]major [/p]source of income.<br><br>技 - skill
He was supposed to deliver the [c= seal 卩]seal [/c]as soon as possible, but because the [c=&quot;noon light&quot; ]noon light [/c]was to draining, the driver decided to [k]unhitch [/k]his horses (and have a pause) anyway. The [p]two dwarfs [/p]offer him a beer in their [p]shack[/p].
The [c=sun <span style="color:#0000ff;">日</span> ]sun [/c]moved [c= towards <span style="color:#0000ff;">向</span>]towards [/c]south, now it's obviously [k]midday[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]enjoys middays in [p]Shanghai[/p].
&quot;I [c= feel 感]feel [/c]strange. My [c=heart 心 ]heart [/c]is aching...&quot; &quot;Do you still [k]mourn [/k]him?&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p]seems to be more [p]Han [/p]than he believed to be.
The [c=water ]water [/c]was [c= good 良]good[/c], it's too bad it was not well managed by the [k]wasteful [/k]government. The [p]dwarf [/p]is angry because of such amount of [p]languishing [/p]water.
&quot;At this [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of the cave and in the whole [c= area 区]area [/c]it is strictly forbidden to [k]vomit[/k]!&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]reads it and says: &quot;[p]Oh [/p]no! I ate something wrong before.&quot;
He sees the [c=sun ]sun [/c]and the [c= light]light [/c]causes him to [k]sway[/k]. The [p]guardian dwarf[/p]<span style="color:#0000ff;"> </span>(responsible for security) suggests hiding in the [p]hangar [/p]again.
As you were sitting by the [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]and complaining about the [c= nation 邦]nation[/c], you could hear the [k]watchman's rattle [/k](of the coming watchman). &quot;[p]Bang[/p]!&quot; the [p]giant[/p] crashed into the tree as he was trying to flee.
To this wooden (made from [c= tree 木]trees[/c]) [k]frame[/k], you can [c=add 加 ]add[/c] stuff. The [p]two dwarfs[/p] add [p]jars [/p]here and there to it. Hopefully nobody will fight over it.
He [c= boast 夸]boastes[/c] that he is so strong that even the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]is afraid of him - until he gots a kick in his [k]thigh [/k](and crouches down in pain).  It was the [p]dwarf[/p]: &quot;[p]Kuá[/p], don't boast here.&quot;
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]attempted to to [k]steal [/k]a [c= catamaran 俞]catamaran[/c], however he crashed into a [p]giant[/p]'s [p]toe [/p](who was bathing it in the river).
When you apply a [c= sugar-basin]sugar-basin [/c]to your [c=tongue ]tongue[/c], it will hopefully produce a very [k]sweet [/k]taste. The [p]two fairies [/p]cooking [p]tandoori[/p] - they can only use sugar directly to their tongues, not to the food (it would taste not so good...&quot;)
(Military ethiquette explanation.) To show [c=to respect 敬 ]respect[/c], [k]upheave [/k]your [c= hand 手]hand [/c]- approximately so high that it reaches the [p]fairy[/p]'s [p]chin[/p].
You want to [c= carve 契]carve [/c]something to the [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c]? It might be best first to cut it with a [k]wedge[/k]. Ask for help of the [p]two giants [/p]from the nearby [p]shack[/p].
[c=small 小 ]Small [/c]pieces of [c= earth 土]earth [/c]are called [k]dust[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]hates dust, especially now, when she found the [p]česnek [/p]she wanted to eat covered in dust.
I need a [c=substitute 代 ]substitute [/c]for [c= clothes 衣]clothes[/c]. He draws a <span style="font-style:italic;">sack </span>out of his [k]pocket[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]says: &quot;[p]Dye [/p]this and then you can wear it.&quot;
He holds his stuff with one [c=hand 扌 ]hand[/c], and with the [c= right hand 又 ]right hand [/c]he keeps hitting the [c= pigeon 隹]pigeons [/c]that fly to his [k]vendor's stand[/k]. (It probably was not a good idea to sell oats on a stand.) The [p]giant [/p]tries to help him, and installs a [p]tannoy [/p](to scare the pigeons).
She [c=sigh 乃 ]sighs[/c], as she was [k]pregnant [/k]with a [c= child 子]child [/c](and wasn't sure about her financial status). The [p]dwarf [/p]suggests asking the [p]Union[/p] for help.
Hey! [c= Shun the sage 舜]Shun the sage [/c]looks as if his [c=eye 目 ]eye [/c]was watching me! And now he [k]winked[/k]!<br />But the [p]dwarf [/p]ignores it, and continues to [p]shun [/p]ancient literature.
If you eat some of the [c=moon 月 ]moon [/c]powder, you will live [c= forever 永]forever[/c]! Unless somebody cuts your [k]veins[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]drug dealer thinks he is more convincing when he wears a [p]miter[/p].
The [c=government <span style="color:#00aa00;">府</span> ]goverment [/c]have ordered no [c= meat <span style="color:#0000ff;">肉</span>]meat [/c]to be eaten (in this month) - so all the meat (in stores) [k]decay[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]complains: &quot;It's an enormous waste of [p]food[/p]!&quot;
(as in Nü Wa 女娲 - the creator of humanity)<br />The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]was able to summon a [c= vortex 呙]vortex [/c]with a simple wink of her hand - it was because she was a descendant of Nü [k]Wa[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]got afraid: &quot;[p]Waa[/p]!&quot;
If his [c=heart ⺖]heart [/c]didn't break, he could have enjoyed a [c= good fortune 幸]good fortune[/c]. But it did - that would probably make him [k]upset [/k](if he were not dead). The [p]dwarf [/p]puts a [p]shiling [/p]on his grave (and is happy that the fortune comes to him).
He meets then a [c=corpse with microphone ]corpse with a microphone[/c]: It speaks to him: &quot;Look at my [c= eye <span style="color:#0000ff;">目</span>]eye[/c]. ... Closer, to my [k]eyebrow[/k].&quot; The [p]fairy [/p](a companion) says: &quot;This is the last clue in this [p]maze[/p]. &quot;
This [c= silk 帛]silk thread [/c]is [k]continuous [/k](it is never ending). The [p]two fairies[/p] it is a real [p]menace[/p][c=thread ] [/c](to the textile business).
He watches him finish the [c=whiskey bottle 酉 ]whiskey bottle[/c]. Only after he has drunk it all he [c= inform 告]informs [/c]him, he was so [k]doggish [/k]to mix it with poison. The [p]dwarf [/p]comments it is a [p]cool [/p]way to murder somebody.
At the [c= birth 㐬]birth [/c]of the (future) [c=king 王 ]king[/c], a [k]precious stone [/k]fell from the heaven. The [p]two fairies [/p]covered it with [p]locus [/p]leaves - the precious stone is kept in the palace garden to the present day.
There was a lot of work to do, so he had to [c= dry / work 干]work [/c]even under [c=moon 月 ]moonlight[/c]. So, now deliver this [k]liver [/k]to the [p]giant [/p]on the [p]gantry[/p]...
The [c= kid 子]kid [/c]points at a [c=grain 禾 ]grain [/c]field: &quot;At what [k]season [/k](of the year) will it be harvested?&quot; &quot;In the current one: look, there is the [p]dwarf [/p]coming in a [p]jeep[/p] (to supervise the harvest).
&quot;Could you give me a [c=hand ]hand [/c]to [k]erase [/k](<span style="font-style:italic;">wipe</span>) the blackboard?&quot; Somebody have painted two [c=???]tips [/c]of an arrow there. [p]Teddy [/p]says: &quot;Well, it doesn't look like a very good [p]model [/p]anyway.&quot;<br><br>also pronounced:<br><span style="color:#ff0000;">ma</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">mo</span>
The [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]was [c= to offer (tribute) 奉]offered (as a tribute)[/c] to the king, who gave it to his bodyguard - who turned it into his [k]cudgel[/k]. He tests it on the [p]dwarf [/p](whom he doesn't like so much): &quot;[p]Bang[/p]!&quot;
The [c=insect 虫 ]insect [/c]liked hiding in [c= thick weeds 莽]thick weeds[/c], because [k]pythons [/k]cannot be easily seen there. But [p]Teddy [/p]likes cutting out grass - so he [p]mangled [/p]his plans.
The person controllong the [c=water 水 ]water [/c]cutter [c= utter 曰]uttered[/c]: &quot;We need the water to [k]run swiftly [/k]if the cutter is to work!&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]offers to try speed up the <span style="font-style:italic;">confused </span>water in exchange for a [p]goose[/p].<br /><br />vs: <span style="color:#0000ff;">汨</span>
The [c= 斯 Slovak]Slovak [/c]and Slovenka are [k]with one another [/k]on a [c=cliff 厂 ]cliff[/c]. The [p]giant [/p]offer to make a photo of them: &quot;[p]Sýr[/p]!&quot;
&quot;Could can there be [c= a well 井]a well [/c]on a [c=mound ]mound[/c]?&quot; &quot;Run away, it's a [k]snare[/k]!&quot; And really: A [p]Teddy [/p]starts [p]jingling [/p]bells to alert them that he is already there.
You [c= stand]stand [/c]at one place, totally [k]exhausted[/k]. [p]Two fairies [/p]fly-by - they carry a [p]jelly [/p]cake and offer you a piece. But you don't care, you just want something to [c=&quot;a drink&quot; ]drink[/c].
The [c=grass 艹 ]grass [/c]was not getting enough water because of the [c= watery waste 巟]watery waste[/c]. It began to look [k]desolate[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p](guarding it) tries to get some water out of the [p]hangar[/p].
(The doctor says:) [c= because 因]Because[/c] you have such a small [c=mouth 口 ]mouth[/c], I can't get my scope into your [k]throat[/k]. Fortunately (for me), the [p]giant [/p]has [p]yan [/p]to tear your mouth more open.
He picked up what he thought was a [c=dime 角 ]dime[/c], but it turned out to be an [c= insect 虫]insect[/c]. &quot;Don't [k]touch [/k]me!&quot; it says. But the [p]dwarf [/p]laughs and uses it as a [p]chewing gum[/p].
The ceremonial [c=division 分 ]division [/c]of the [c= page 页]page [/c]indicated it was solemnly [k]promulgated[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]performing the ceremony cut his hand accidentaly, so he has to [p]bandage[/p] afterwards.
The [c=leather 革 ]leather [/c]armor was very [c= {convenient 便}]convenient[/c]. It doesn't hurt when he gets lashed by the [k]whip[/k]. But it is too small for the [p]two giants [/p]- the make themselves armor of some [p]benches [/p]instead (that can take whips for sure).
He puts his [c=hand ]hand [/c]into the [p]concrete [/p]mixer - but it's [c= empty 空]empty[/c]. The [p]dwarf [/p]that was in [k]control [/k]of the supplies is <span style="font-style:italic;">accused</span>.
The only [c=woman 女 ]women [/c]in the [c= area 区]area [/c]were all [k]crones[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]playing [p]ukulele [/p]had no sucess there. In the end he had to escape in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>.
The king stretches his [c=hand 手 ]hand[/c], as they offer the [c= to offer (tribute) 奉]tribute[/c]. And suddenly, you can hear [k]clasping[/k]. It is the [p]Teddy[/p], to praise that they brought the tribute [p]punctually[/p].
What are these [c= tiny 戋]tiny [/c]pieces of [c=food ]food[/c]? That's my food [k]preserves[/k]. The [p]two dwarf [/p]despise it as they thinks real [p]gentlemen [/p]don't need food preserves (that they donate it to the poor).
(PAL1) The [c=moon 月]moon [/c]priest was in [c= danger 危]danger [/c]- the thing he made was too [k]brittle [/k](and kept crashing). The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]was keeping [p]statistics [/p]of how many times it broke.
Get up and put on your [c= clothes 衣]clothes[/c]! [c=now 今 ]Now[/c]! But the kid is still lying on the [k]coverlets [/k](and doesn't feel like getting up). But he jumps out immediately as he spots the [p]giant[/p]'s [p]chin [/p]in front of his window.
His [c=voice 声 ]voice [/c]is always interuppted, as he has to [k]cough slightly [/k]often. You give him a [c=　strike 殳]strike [/c]in the back - but it was a little too strong, and the [p]dwarf [/p]crashed his [p]chin [/p]into the table.
The [c=earth 土 ]earth [/c]was covered by a [c= cloud 云]cloud [/c](to express the holiness of that place). You can see the notice: &quot;Here will the [k]altar [/k]be!&quot; The [p]fairy [/p]flies around, offering [p]tandori [/p]to the workers.
Watch your [c=foot 足 ]foot[/c]! If the [c= senior 尊]senior [/c]sees us, it will be trouble! Better [k]crouch[/k] down! But the [p]giant [/p]goes normally, he's just a [p]dunce[/p].
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]goes to a market that is [c= between 介]between [/c](two houses). He asks the [p]two dwarfs [/p]sellers about the [k]price[/k], however he doesn't understand their [p]jargon[/p].
My [c=gold 金 ]gold [/c]was here [c= just now 甫]just now[/c], and now it is nowhere in the [k]store [/k]to find! The [p]dwarf [/p]managed to leave with it, and he is already dreaming of a new house with a swimming [p]pool[/p].
They have brought a [c= tree 木]tree [/c]from the [c=west 西 ]west[/c]. The one producing [k]chestnuts[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]lets collect the nuts to make a [p]liter[/p] of a liker.
There is an argument over the [c=corpse 尸　]corpse [/c]of [c= Great Yǔ 禹]Great Yǔ[/c]: &quot;In what [k]category [/k]should he be burried? Mythical leaders or dynasty founders?&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]suggests: &quot;[p]Shoe [/p]wearers!&quot;
After the [c= explosion 甬]explosion [/c]inside the [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c], (it's inhabitants have obviously done something wrong) that what's left of it resembles [k]buckets[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]runs in with his [p]tongs[/p], tries to save whoever bug he can.
He puts the [c= ancient bronze wine holder with 3 legs and loop handle 爵]ancient wine holder [/c]to his [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]- and then, he beginns to [k]chew [/k]the wine. Why? Because he heard chewing produces good hormones, and he wants to win the [p]jousting [/p]match agains the [p]two fairies[/p].
The [c= prefecture 州]prefecture [/c]was washed by [c=water 水 ]water [/c]so long that it is now a new [k]continent[/k]! The [p]giant [/p]still thinks it is just a bad [p]joke[/p].
A lot of drinkable water did [c=perish 亡 ]perish [/c]because of the [c= flood 川]flood [/c]- it was a [k]watery waste[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]tries to save the water in the [p]hangar [/p]he is guarding.
The [c= fortune teller 卜]fortune teller [/c]brings her [c=jade tablet 圭 ]jade tablet [/c]and puts it on one of the eight [k]trigrams[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guarding the house advises her to use [p]garlic[/p], too.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]became [c= an official 官]an official[/c]: the official [k]herdsman[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]will help him by guarding the domestic animals from a [p]gantry[/p].
I go with [p]Wei [/p]on the [c=field 田 ]field [/c]watch the [c= moon 月]moon[/c], wanna go too?&quot; The [p]dwarf [/p]answers: &quot;Yeah, at least can I fill my [k]stomach [/k]with the grains.&quot;<br />(n.b.: part-of-body in which you feed the products grown on the field)
The [c= fortune teller]fortune teller [/c]opens her [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]and says: Cow makes [k]Boo[/k], [p]Teddies [/p]don't do [p]boo[/p].
The [c=woman 女 ]woman [/c]is [k]comely[/k]. She looked especially beautiful when she got hysteric because of the [c= a small worm 肙]small worm [/c]on her seat. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]asks the [p]jean [/p](as the ghostly giant is afraid of small worms, even though he is ghostly; he guards the car).
Why is it [k]dark[/k], when the [c=sun 日 ]sun [/c]is [c= {not yet 未}]not yet [/c]set? It's the spell the [p]dwarf [/p]had to cast to become a [p]major [/p]magican. (But he cheated - he only concealed the windows).
The [c=shelter 广 ]shelter [/c]was very [c= big 大]big[/c], but there were so many people in that it still was too narrow there. Somebody can really [k]celebrate[/k]! That makes the [p]dwarf [/p]not so happy as he can only see many people's [p]chink[/p].
You are on a [c= walk 走]walk[/c] and meet an [k]apprentice[/k] (of the fire mages school). As he [c=???]steps forward[/c] you notice he's bare headed, so you ask the [p]fairy[/p] to summon a [p]toupee[/p] (with red hair) for him.
[c=harry ]Harry [/c]comes to the [c= government <span style="color:#00aa00;">府</span>]government [/c]building, he has to [k]stoop [/k]- to read a note on the ground: &quot;The government is looking for the [p]Teddy [/p]that paid taxes with [p]foo [/p]instead of money.&quot;
What is the [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]with the snake on it called? Did you plant it your[c= self 己]self[/c]? [k]Chinese wolfberry shrub[/k]. No, [p]Teddy [/p]planted it himself, hoping it will grow [p]cheese [/p](he misread &quot;chinese&quot; for &quot;cheese&quot;).<br><img src="paste_jZeQG.jpg" />
You hand to endure various [c= hardship]hardships [/c]when you wanted to move all the hay from the temporary [c=tent ]tent [/c]to the [k]barn[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]tries hard to do it with [p]Stanges[/p].
The [c= car 车]car [/c]is [c=cover ]covered[/c] by a blanket with a [k]military [/k]theme. They are on a secret mission to kidnap the [p]giant[/p]'s [p]žuna[/p].
The [c=thread ]thread [/c]was used to [c= dishonor 辱]dishonor [/c]the king. They created an [k]adorned [/k]piece of satiric work. The [p]dwarf [/p]only makes only [p]R.rrrr. [/p]as he sees that.
Everybody felt that there is something [c=good 良 ]good [/c]about the [c= city]city[/c]. It was because of the care paid by the [k]minister[/k]. Even the [p]fairy [/p]had nothing to worry about and could [p]languish[/p] all day.
The fruit growing on the [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c] that was [c= extending all the way across 亘]extending all the way across [/c]the garten was [k]Chinese soapberry[/k]. The [p]ghostly fairy [/p]guards it for her [p]Han [/p]family.<br><img src="pastecilean.jpg" />
If you want to whistle, your [c=mouth ]mouth [/c]has to [c= resemble 肖]resemble[/c] a [k]whistle[/k]. Or you can ask the [p]dwarf [/p]to give you a [p]shower[/p]<span style="color:#0000ff;"> </span>head thing to whistle with.
The [c=seashell 贝 ]seashell [/c]was [c= occupied 占]occupied [/c](in growing pearls) - so we added a [k]sticker [/k]to it: &quot;Occupied&quot;. But the [p]two giants [/p]collecting [p]turnips [/p]and seashells zealously collected even the occupied ones.
Her [c=heart 心 ]heart [/c]was so [c= obscure/mysterious 奥]obscure and mysterious[/c]... He [k]deplored [/k]ever meeting her. Now the [p]dwarf [/p]does nothing the whole day, only uses his [p]AOL [/p]connection.
His [c=heart ]heart [/c]started beating at a higher [c= level 平]level[/c], he is quite [k]impulsive[/k]: the [p]giant [/p]is afraid that he won't be [p]punctual[/p].
He was sitting by the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of a cave (couldn't find way home). I [c= agree 荅]agree [/c]only because I'm in [k]despair[/k]! The [p]dwarf [/p]offered him to let the [p]Tarzan[/p] bring him home (for a horrendous fee).
[c= an official 官]An official [/c]was send to select the [c=tree 木 ]tree [/c]that will be used to make the lord's [k]coffin[/k]. The [p]ghostly giant [/p]is guarding the [p]gantry[/p] (that will soon be used to transport the tree).
Even after he grew [c=old 古]old[/c], he still loved [c= spicy 辛]spicy[/c] food too much. That was his [k]sin[/k]. The [p]giant [/p]thinks it is a big taint considerg what a [p]guru[/p] he could otherwise be.
The [c= sheep 羊]sheep [/c]had an [c=ilness 疒 ]illness [/c]- her whole body [k]itched[/k]. [p]Teddy [/p]hired a [p]Yankee [/p]to scratch her all the time.
The woman sees her [c= baby 婴]baby [/c]is looking at the [c=tree 木 ]tree[/c]: &quot;It is a [k]cherry [/k]tree&quot; she says. The [p]giant [/p]asks [p]Ying [/p]finds such babies lovely.
When he steps with his [c=foot 足 ]foot [/c]on the nail, he only [c= chirp 喿]chirps[/c]. The next one is [k]hot-tempered[/k]: he orders the [p]zambo [/p]to bring in the [p]dwarf[/p], who is responsible for it.
Please don't forget to remain [k]chaste [/k]- this was written [c=above 上 ]above [/c]the [c=???]seashells [/c](on the beach - a temptation place for chaste people). The [p]giant [/p]tries to talk [p]Janit [/p]not to go there.
It started [c=rain 雨 ]raining[/c], so she goes quickly home from the [c= field 田]field[/c], and especially quickly after she hears the [k]thunder[/k]. Luckily, by the [p]lake[/p], the [p]fairy [/p]meets her (and transports her with a spell).
The key to avoid the <span style="font-weight:600; font-style:italic;">lightnings</span> is the [k]hide / dodge[/k] always when your [c=body ]body[/c] feels a sensation and your [c=???]earlobes[/c] begin to vibrate (it's a sign of an incoming lightning.) (The [p]ghostly Teddy[/p] comments: &quot;Or you can pay me [p]dollars[/p], and I'll protect you from the lightnings.&quot;)
Who is that [c= woman 女]woman [/c]there that's letting herself wash by the [c=wave 波 ]waves[/c]? It's my [k]grandmother[/k]. The [p]fairy [/p]flies there to warn her that a [p]porcupine [/p]is going to be brought by the next wave.
He stood on the [c=platform 台 ]platform [/c]- in the shape of a [c= heart 心]heart [/c]- and started [k]idle [/k]chat. The [p]dwarf [/p]forgot to [p]dye [/p]the figures, there is no performance today.
[c=Harry ]Harry [/c]collects [c= jade block 圭]jade blocks[/c]. This one is [k]fine[/k], he thoughts. The [p]two giants [/p]put it in a[p] jar [/p]- and carry it solemnly to his home.
&quot;What [c=illness ]illness [/c]do you have? Why are you not standing [c= upright 正]upright[/c]?&quot; &quot;Could be any [k]malady[/k]. It began after I returned from the [p]jungle [/p]tour lead by the [p]dwarf[/p].&quot;
After the revolution, all imperial [c= clothing 衣 (split in two parts)]clothing [/c]was torn in two, and a &quot;[c=public 公 ]public[/c]&quot; note was stick inside it. Only the [k]imperial robe [/k]was spared. [p]Teddy [/p]angrily: &quot;[p]Goons[/p]! Such disaster are you!&quot;
The king is wearing [c= horns]horns [/c](cornua), and they are [c=whole 全 ]whole [/c]of [k]gold[/k]! The [p]giant [/p]has been drinking too much [p]gin[/p], so he has visions now.
If you will keep [k]jumping[/k] with your [c=foot ]foot[/c] upwards, you will probably [c=???]die young [/c](because you might hit the [p]dwarf[/p], and he'll say  [p]&quot;[/p][p]You, eh?[/p][p]&quot; [/p]before killing you).
The [p]dwarf[/p] [c= right hand]shakes hands[/c] with her and [k]gasps[/k]: &quot;What a strange [c=mouth ]mouth [/c]does she have. He reports her than with the [p]tannoy[/p].&quot;
&quot;Why are you so [c=black 黑 ]black[/c]? And you [c= sound 音]sound[/c] so [k]dull[/k]?&quot; &quot;The [p]dwarf[/p]... he... he... gave me some [p]antibiotics[/p].&quot;
The [c=stream  洰 ]stream [/c]has been led throught a hollow cut [c= tree 木]tree[/c], to make a [k]canal[/k] (for the watering). <span style="font-style:italic;">In pouring rain</span>, the [p]fairy [/p]doesn't have to watch it (because the fields are watered throught the pouring rain), so she sits on in and chews a [p]chewing [/p]gum.<br /><br />&quot;your servant&quot; 臣 + water 水 = stream 洰. &quot;Your servant&quot; helped you to stream in water throught rores (so he doesn't have to go to the well anymore).
He took another [c=step forward ]step forward [/c]- but it was [c= surplus 余]surplus [/c]already, so he was [k]gently [/k]pushed backwards. The [p]fairy [/p]wants no visitors near her famous [p]shoe[/p] cabinet - when it's <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain </span>(they would make it wet).
He converted an entire room into a [k]furnace[/k]. When you open the [c= door 户]door[/c], you can see only [c=fire 火 ]fire[/c]! &quot;Are you [p]lunatic[/p]?&quot; asks the [p]fairy[/p].
He takes a [c=step forward 彳]step forward[/c], but has to go back again, as an [c= imperial 卸]imperial [/c]convoy is [k]driven[/k] by. The [p]dwarf [/p]normally plays [p]ukulele [/p]as an early warning, but today it's <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>, so he remained home.
There was a [c=sign 示 ]sign [/c]next to a [c= sign 示]sign[/c]: the owner [k]rationalized [/k]that it would attract more customers. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guards the [p]sand [/p]castle (he makes sure nobody gets in without paying).
&quot;Stop [c= stop 止]picking [/c]your [c=ear 耳 ]ear[/c], that's a [k]disgrace [/k]to the others!&quot; [p]Teddy [/p]gives you [p]chapati [/p]to disgrace other with instead.
He takes the [c=bow 弓　]bow[/c], aims at the [c= stick]stick[/c], and [k]draws [/k]- but before shooting, his [p]yin [/p]get's disturbed by [p]Teddy [/p]coming in.
He flew to the [c=mouth 口 ]mouth [/c]of cave, to enjoy the [c= wonderful 奂]wonderful [/c]scenery - instead of listening to his [k]yelling [/k]wife. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]is guarding his [p]hands [/p](as he had to climb up there (the ghostly dwarf doesn't like yelling either).
The [c=valley 谷 ]valley [/c]was [c= lacking 欠]lacking [/c]any presence of human beings. He could follow any [k]lust [/k]he had. The [p]dwarf [/p]fulfills his greatest one: playing [p]yukulele [/p]in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>.
The [c=fire 火 ]fire [/c]seemed, after starting the [c= music 乐]music[/c], even more [k]luminous[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guards the participant's [p]shoes[/p].<br />vs <span style="color:#0000ff;">炼</span> - smelt
The [c=king ⺩ ]king [/c]loves collecting [c= lucid 粲]lucid [/c]stuff, because it [k]glisters[/k] beautifully in his room then. The [p]dwarf [/p]butler  however, cannot [p]stand [/p]it (so he never goes inside the king's room).
Stumbling upon a [c=corpse 尸 ]corpse [/c]might mean [c= trouble 娄]trouble [/c]- [k]frequently [/k]it means that the murderer is still there (and you will become a corpse, too). [p]Teddy [/p]warned you before it is [p]lurdiculous [/p]to go out in <span style="font-style:italic;">pouring rain</span>.
The [c=shabby (敝) ]shabby[/c] rat - the [p]pet[/p] of the [p]two giants[/p] - opens it's one [c= eye]eye[/c]: but shoots only a [k]glance[/k] to you, after that it continues eating it's futter.
(In court.) The [c= plantiff 曹]plantiff [/c]says: &quot;We have delivered high quality [c=rice 米 ]rice[/c]!&quot; &quot;It was just some [k]dregs[/k]!&quot; answers the [p]giant [/p]on behalf of the [p]zambo[/p].
On the [c=boat 舟 ]boat[/c], don't forget it! What &quot;[c= it 它]it[/c]?&quot; &quot;It! The [k]helm[/k]!&quot; The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]guards &quot;it&quot; while he packs the [p]dollars [/p]for the journey.
The [k]poor [/k]people had to live in a [c=hole ]hole[/c], left after a [c= power]power[/c] plant. The [p]two fairies[/p] - living according to the lifestyle made by the philosopher [p]Qiong[/p], help them to build some better living houses.
It was quite [c= lengthy 攸]lengthy [/c]to work at the [c=bamboo ⺮ ]bamboo [/c]plantage, and it was very frustrating that only a [k]dwarf bamboo [/k]was produced. But the [p]two Teddies [/p]don't mind: they will take a [p]shower [/p]afterwards.
He askes if the reason why he became [c= one-eyed 眇]one-eyed [/c]is that he was trying to [c=thread ⺰]thread [/c]a needle - but he only got a [k]vague [/k]answer. The true reason was that he was running after the [p]mouse [/p]brought by the [p]two Teddies [/p](that started escaping).
The [c= king 王 ]king [/c]wants [c=horns ]horns [/c]in his dish. So they [k]cover [/k]the [c=???]dish [/c]- and the [p]dwarf [/p]uses [p]guy [/p]ropes to catch an ox.
They even mind that the farmer [c=hand 手 ]hands [/c]could be a bad [c= omen 兆]omen [/c]- the town officials are [k]nitpicking [/k]too much. The [p]two giants [/p]go to the [p]town [/p]hall to complain.
On the [c= field 田 ]field[/c], animal [c=horns 丷 ]horns [/c]have been [c= pile up (一 on top of 口)]piling up [/c]still higher. What kind of [k]beast [/k]could live there? The [p]dwarf [/p]goes there with his [p]shotgun [/p]to investigate.
There was [c= none 莫]none [/c]in the [c=house ]house[/c]. Starting feeling [k]lonesome [/k]nowadays. Perhaps I should buy some [p]models [/p]from the [p]dwarf[/p].
A [c=trickle 巛 ]trickle [/c]was directed to the [c= fruit 果]fruit[/c]. The birds hoped to speed it up, that it would grow to a big tree soon, because they wanted build a [k]nest [/k]there. The [p]fairy [/p]hopes with them, because she needs fruits from the tree for her [p]chowder[/p].
There were [c=fish 鱼 ]fish [/c]lying in the [c= sun 日]sun[/c]. The fisherman was so [k]crass[/k] (not to know they will start to stink). [p]Teddy [/p]tries to catch some with a [p]loop [/p](not working very well...).
What are you standing here by the [c=mouth ]mouth[/c] of the cave, when all others have hard [c= toil]toil[/c] inside the cave? We talk here: a [k]chatter[/k] is a toil too. Especially when we have to speak so [p]loud[/p] for the [p]fairy[/p] to hear us.
His [c=hand 手 ]hand [/c]fell into a [c= pitfall (archaic) 臽]pitfall [/c]- and suddenly something [k]nipped [/k]it! The [p]shark [/p]was put there by the [p]two giants[/p], in hope to catch some wild animals. (A living trap... )
The [c=insect 虫 ]insect [/c]of the [c= vermilion (a color) 朱]vermilion [/c]color might be a [k]spider[/k]. He got ermilion after listening to the [p]giant[/p]'s [p]jukebox[/p].
Instead of the door were [c=teeth 齿]teeth [/c]hang up at the entry to the [c= accommodation 屋]accommodation[/c]. He was not so [k]small-minded [/k]to mind it. The [p]dwarf[/p], however, [p]whoops [/p]as he sees it.
The [c=arrow 矢 ]arrow [/c]is so big it could only be used by a [c= tall 乔]tall [/c]person. Please [k]rectify [/k]it as soon as possible. The [p]two Teddies [/p]want to have it before the [p]jousting [/p]match (as they are not so tall).
[c=from 从 ]From [/c]where is that what sounds in my [c= ear 耳]ear[/c]? It sounds quite [k]lofty[/k]. It's a [p]song [/p]sung by  [p]Teddy [/p](he can sing quite lofty when he wants).
A new [k]sect [/k]has moved into the neighboring [c=house 宀 ]house[/c], a [c= sign 示]sign[/c] states that they are worshipping a [p]giant [/p]from [p]Zongo[/p].
He drops [c= drop]drops[/c] of [c= earth 土 ]earth [/c]from a [c=cliff 厂 ]cliff [/c]- this way he creates [k]pressure [/k](needed by a machine under the cliff). The [p]giant [/p]thinks it is a good way to produce [p]yarns[/p].
There was a lot of traffic by the [c=gate 门 ]gate [/c]that leads into the city - the place was really [c= alive 活]alive[/c]. That's why the gate has to be very [k]broad[/k]. The [p]ghostly dwarfs[/p] sits on above it and guards the [p]coal [/p]vagons going in and out.
(He found some kind of artifact.) Ok please [c=drag ]drag [/c]it [c= straight 直]straight [/c]here. What is it? A [k]shield[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]takes a [p]duncee [/p]cap to show you how stupid he thinks you are (not recognizing it instantly).
Give me a [c=hand 手 ]hand [/c]to [c= settle down 氐]settle down[/c]! We have to [k]press against [/k]the adventureous desires. But [p]Teddy [/p]dislikes these [p]deeds[/p].
&quot;Are you [c=Harry ⺅ ]Harry[/c]? No, you just [c= resemble 肖]resemble [/c]him - Harry doesn't look so [k]smart[/k].&quot; Actually, it is Harry and he looks so smart because of eating some [p]chowder [/p]produced by the [p]two dwarfs[/p].
The have blocked the [c=road ]road [/c]by piling up [c= bean 豆]beans[/c]. They wanted him to [k]stay [/k]with them. The [p]dwarf [/p]even killed the [p]dodo[/p] bird that could fly him otherwise.
In the new discipline they had to use [c=foot ⻊ ]foot [/c]to [c= pick 采]pick [/c]the apple from the tree, [k]stamp [/k]it and <span style="font-style:italic;">step on </span>the line. [p]Teddy [/p]applauses to everybody who did it in [p]style[/p].
The [c=king 王 ]king [/c]was [c= concentrated 耑]concentrated[/c], trying to think of a [k]propitious [/k]time. The [p]ghostly dwarf [/p]suggested:&quot;[p]Relinquish[/p] such ideas!&quot;

The [c= one 一]unicorn [/c]has only one door at his [c=house 宀 ]house[/c], so he has only one [k]space between the door and the entrance screen[/k]. The [p]dwarf [/p]suggests decorating it with [p]jewels [/p](so that he can steal them later).

There is [c=none 莫 ]none [/c]in the bathroom anyway, so she hangs only a [c= towel 巾]towel [/c]in place of the [k]curtain[/k]. This changes the [p]mood [/p]of the [p]dwarf[/p].
