Note this site works also as a (kind of) dictionary for e-book readers.
<p>
Simply run your text through the <a href="<?php echo Yii::app()->createUrl("/annotator/input", array("modeID"=>3)); ?>">annotator</a> and create a MOBI or EPUB file. 
<p>
You can then click on any character in the text and see the translation. If the character is the beginning of a word,
you will see the translation of the word as well.
