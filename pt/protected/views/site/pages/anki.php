As I've visited a friend of mine recently, her son was just unwrapping 
a shiny package full of small cartoon cards. The pleasing smell of ozone filled the room.
On the face of the first card was a green frog with a friendly smile. These were not Pexeso. 
Nor poker cards. On the other side was something written: "der Frosch".
These were flashcards meant to learn German.
 
MADE ME THINK

Q&A EFFECT
----
.... (Q&A) experiment

Why is that? 
It's called the Questions and Answers Effect. If you are asked a question, 
you will remember the answer you give significantly better than if you just read it somewhere.

//
So what about having a piece of software that would keep asking you questions
again and again? Would that help your memory?

This is what Anki is about.

SPACED REPETITION
Imagine you would make a list of ten words you want to learn, and then 
review this list every morning for five days in a row. Would you remember
all the words for a very long time? 

In fact, NO! Contrary to what it might seem, ...

MY LEVEL RISEN TO A

USED FOR EVERYTHING
 (splitting - if you are not able to do that)


as I got the results with the A I knew I was right

FOR VOCABULARY ONLY COMPLEMENTARY
Note that, what the language learning concerns, I don't 
advocate spending your life practicing vocablary with your flashcards.

RESULTS

(**advantage - learn much better)

Tip: ut easy to learn even when we are tired.

Another significant advatage I observed is you can learn 
When tired, I can't imagine opening taking a book without falling asleep, but with anki you can really push hard.
Juice the books for flashcards when you are fresh, and cram it when you are sleepy.

By the way, that is the number one thing I do with #VNC on my kindle (with raspberry pi)#.
