<h1>Practical tips</h1>

<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<?php /* this section content sorting */ ?>
<p>Aside from reading books, learn the vocabulary you find interesting using <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">Anki</a>. There is even a free android version, so you can repeat even while commuting or while standing in a queue.

/*
Books are your friend
 any level
 get them for free
   (more contemporary/popular, easy level) 
 use a reader
   (I don't like staring into a LCD screen too much)
 dictionary
   (medieval)
   (no pressure to learn)
 translation
   (if you note you don't understand a word)
 audio
   (makes more interesting)
 you'll keep getting better
    (it takes slightly longer than you expect, but then you cross a threshold)

<p>I've heard about polyglots that report never having to lookup a word in a dictionary - they simply rely on the simultaneous translated text. 
In this way they could stay totally immersed and never waste time turning pages of a dictionary. 

But I think that only applies to paper dictionaries.
Nowadays you can lookup a word in 
an electronic dictionary in less than a second - you won't lose time doing so,
it might even be faster that trying to pick the right word from the simultaneous text.
And I find that consulting a dictionary helps remembering the word even faster.

<h2>Media</h2>
<p>At times, you might feel like you are pretty fed up with your books. Maybe you feel like not able to read a single page, too bored with all this learning.
That is the right time for some relaxation! Get some videoclips, music or movies - in your target language. Just make sure you get the subtitles as well. Even though I am not a real fan of subconscious learning, this immersion that happens as you watch a movie is amazing. Many phrases will simply stick in your head effortlessly. 

<p>Once I devoted one week of my summer vacation to learning Chinese in this manner. I watched quite a few of Chinese Wuxia from <a href="http://www.ancientchinese.net">Ancient Chinese forum</a> (many of them have simultaneous English and Chinese subtitles, making it a perfect choice).

<p>When anybody asked, what I did during my winter vacation, I could respond: “Learning Chinese intensively!”, leaving them pretty impressed. :-)
I did not disclose that, actually, all I did was watching Chinese movies ten hours daily :-)
But honestly, I did more progress then if I believe I would using only the traditional language learning methods. And I felt more relaxed after this week than ever before.
