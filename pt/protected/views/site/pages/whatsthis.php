<h2>Cryptic Chinese made readable!</h2>
<p>
I'm really happy to share this tool,
using which I achieved a high level of Chinese reading skills in a short period of time,
because now you can benefit as well. You will be suprised of how quickly you will progress.
</p>

<h2>Enjoyable</h2>
<p>
As I got the crazy idea of learning Chinese, the first course I stumbled upon was one made by 
<a href="http://fsi-language-courses.org/">FSI</a>. Ok, it looks professional, it's free, audio included,
many drills... However, I met a little problem. After finishing Lesson One, I had to give up - in order not to die of boredom. 
</p>

<p>
Soon I understood this is not the way to do it - learning should be fun at least a little. 
</p>

<h2>Effective</h2>
<p>
So I went looking for something more fun. It's not hard to find some entertainment. A few flash games 
that taught me how to count from one to ten, a youtube video that explains how to say "Hello!", 
a colorful website that lists a few common expressions...  
</p>

<p>
It's great to know how to say "How are you?" and how to express gratitude. However, that is not 
what I meant by learning a language.  
</p>

<h2>Epic</h2>
<p>
I wanted a method that would take me to an advanced level, without tiring me be with dry vocabulary lists,
an ###
</p>

<p>
And I found something. Books. I don't mean grammar books. I mean real books. Books that tell a story.  
</p>

<p>
But to read a book in a foreign language, you need to have a pretty good knowledge of that language, right?
Actually, no. 
</p>

### you can GD - fine for normal langs
### By being in such a close contact with the real life text, your skills will develop rapidly.
### for CN mnemonic system - this site (for yourself; share)
### book
### give for free - because I believe learning should be free. (Donations - develop)

<h2>How to start</h2>
<p>
So, why don you just try it out?
Take a quick glance at the <a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl('/site/page', array('view'=>'demonstration')); ?>">demo page</a> first.
</p>

<p>
Then you can <a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl('/char/index'); ?>">browse</a> the available mnemonics
or <a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl('/system/create'); ?>">create</a> your own collection,
which you can then apply in the <a href="<?php echo $this->createUrl('/annotator'); ?>">annotator</a>.
